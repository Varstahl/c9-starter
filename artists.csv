<p>While remaining an acoustic trio featuring a cello, they still managed to fill a stage and find a loyal following before they all graduated and migrated north to Chicago.</p>
<p>They traded the backyards of Peoria for the bar stools of Chicago and in doing so, found a new home. Since then, they've recorded their first full length album titled ""Somewhere to Nowhere"" (available on our STORE and Itunes), and their highly anticipated follow up album entitled ""Some Days"". They've stayed true to their acoustic roots, but always looked for new ways to incorporate fuller sounds while introducing new instruments and sounds.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Curbside is made up of five friends who just enjoy making music. They've always considered themselves lucky to have found a sound that works, but even more so... to have an audience to play to. <br /><br /></p>","Curbside got it's start at Bradley University in Peoria Illinois back in late 2004.

These two offerings can be booked on 2 different nights or combined together for a longer show:

The first is my solo concert, A JERSEY VOICE: Sinatra to Springsteen...and Everyone in Between.  Featuring song selections from the 1940's through today, the concert includes songs made popular by such artists as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen and of course, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  Along with a hot seven piece band (many of them ""JB"" alum) audiences are sure to love this great evening of entertainment!

The second offering is A JERSEY BOYS Tribute Show; A 45 minute show that I perform with the TVK Orchestra, one of Chicago's busiest and most well respected corporate, special event and wedding dance bands.  The Tribute features all of the Four Season's most well known hits, including ""Sherry"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"", ""Walk LIke A Man"", ""Dawn"", ""Workin' My Way Back To You"", ""Oh What a Night"" and many more.  The show can also be followed by dance music to get the festival crowd on their feet for however long you'd like.

The TVK Orchestra is one of Chicago's premier wedding, corporate and special event bands who's members perform, record and tour with world-renowned artists and grace the stages of the CSO, Lyric Opera and varied music clubs in Chicago.  They are also the only band in the Chicago area offering this type of tribute and the only band that has permanent members in its line up who performed in the Chicago company of JERSEY BOYS during its entire 3 year run.  This brings an authenticity and credibility to the material from the show that is unmatched by any band anywhere!",,"template.php","default.css",,"inactive","none","0000-00-00 00:00:00","No",,,,"Never show in sitemap","Full",

<p>Oh my Gosh Wes...I have heard so many positive comments from people about the band that night. I received 3 phone calls during the party telling me how wonderful everything was. So many nice compliments ! Jules also told me that you agreed to play at our picnic at the end of June. I was so happy to hear that. You have no idea how much I wanted to be at the party. Thanks for all your efforts in working with us at the club. I'm sure that the word of how fun it was that night is being passed around. Word gets spread to other clubs very fast. Thanks for everything Wes If you are searching for a multi talented country band that will add entertainment and fun to your party, then look no further! Ernie Givens and The White Lies Band will meet and surpass any expectations you could possibly have for a country band. If fact, if these country boys can&rsquo;t set your toes a tapping then your foot must be asleep. We have had all kinds of bands play at our club but this band performs on a much higher level. The perfect mix of fun and professionalism. Ernie Givens and The White Lies Band are the definition of country gentlemen Craig F. Bonifas Phoenix Club President Aurora, Ill. Hi Wes - Just wanted to get in touch with you (and all the guys) to extend our most humble thanks to all of you for the fantastic evening we had when you were here recently. Everyone down here at the campground absolutely raved about the band. And around here, word spreads fast and I know everyone will remember ""Ernie Givens and the White Lies Band"" for a long, long time! You're definitely the best entertainment this campground has ever had! We're all looking forward to seeing you here again next year. In fact, we're trying to organize an outing for many of us to come out to see you when you play in Ottawa in September. Again, from Sandy, Mongo, Jill and the whole gang here at Hide Away Lakes - MANY THANKS - YOU GUYS ROCK! Hide Away Lakes Yorkville, Illinois Hey Wes, I can't say enough about the positive feedback I got from everyone about your band performance on 9/22. You guys did an amazing job! Everyone thought I was some kind of hero for finding you guys! Please feel free to forward this along to your band mates. I loved how enthused everyone was in wanting yuz to do an encore song or two. Thanks for the great entertainment! Don Flynn Sons of the American Legion (S.A.L.) You guys were the BEST at Leisure Lake last night. My husband never danced so much in his life. I usually have to beg him to dance, even at wedding receptions. Not last night. I was amazed Ernie, how much you sound like the original artist, whether it's Dwight Yoakam or George Strait, or everyone in between. Thanks again. Shery Talarico Sullivan Really enjoyed your show tonight at the LaPorte County Fair. We've been enjoying your music for years! Keep up the good work!

<p>South Boulevard is a new band consisting of veterans of the Chicago music scene. The members, with almost 200 years of cumulative musical experience, have shared the stage with such notables as Muddy Waters, James Cotton, Sonny Terry, Brownee Mcghee and Hubert Sumlin.<br /> <br /> They have recorded at CBS Records Chicago, Capitol records LA, Cherokee Sound LA, United Artists Studio LA, Electric Ladyland NY <span>and Blue Wave, Vancouver, BC. </span></p>
<p><span>Rhythm section Steve Flugum (bass) and Steve Capillo (drums) provide a tight, funky bottom that has evolved over 40 years (that&rsquo;s right&mdash;40!) of playing together.<br /> <br /> Guitarists Willie Shields and Chris Discher lock in tough, tight rhythms and heartfelt solos. While having two distinct playing styles, their singing guitars make you feel every note.<br /> <br />This core group is joined by the Third Coast Horn section, two more talented musicians (and their baritone and tenor saxophones.) Chicago natives Bob Fried and Miles Tesar bring with them years of formal education; Miles has a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Saxophone and Bob is a Master of composition who has worked toward his Doctorate in Ethnomusicology. Their skills have also brought these professionals all over the world. From Australia to St. Lucia, they&rsquo;ve played Broadway musicals, chorale pieces, television scores, theatrical productions, gigs with Charo (coochie coochie!)&mdash;oh, and of course, rock, jazz and blues. Bob and Miles&rsquo; amazing accents and clever contratempos raise that special South Boulevard sound to a whole new dimension.</span> <br /> Tying all this music together are the raspy, deep, soulful vocals of Mr. Dudley Fair. This lead singer&rsquo;s raw emotion commands the audience and brings them to their feet.

<p>Northside is a 5 member Rock n Roll tribute band based out of Chicago, covering music from the 1970's through present day. Northside honors bands ranging from classic rock's Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, as well as modern and alternative rock greats such as Nirvana, No Doubt and U2 as well as a montage of dance songs ranging from the 70's to present day. <br /> <br /> In 2003, drummer Chris Stamos, bassist Bob Spilios and guitarist Louie Kritikos reunited their band. They n<span>ow have been playing together for over two decades. They recruited singer and keyboardist Rebecca Bolluyt and Northside Band was born. George Skoubis reunited with the band contributing with some guitar, keyboards and back-up vocals completing Northside’s current line-up and sound.<br /> <br /> Four of the 5 members were born and grew up together on the Northside of Chicago. It is evident by watching them perform live, that Northside is just 5 great friends having a blast performing music together. This attitude and kinship is always sensed by the audiences and has a way of creating a “good times for all” mood for anyone at the show.<br /> <br /> Northside has gig’d at such Chicagoland venues as The Cubby Bear in Wrigleyville, Captian Morgans Club at Wrigley Field, The Beat Kitchen, 27 Live in Evanston, Blarney Island on The Fox River & Abbey Pub in Chicago as well as The Summer on Southport fest, Taste of Lincoln Ave fest., Taste of Lakeview fest, Andersonville Midsumma Fest, Retro on Roscoe, Edison Park Fest and was the head liner  at the Ignite Fest '11 & '12. . <br /> </span></p>","One of Chicagoland's BEST Cover bands!","template.php","default.css","Cover Band, Rock Band, Alternative Rock, Pop & Funk, Dance","active","Monthly - Full","2013-02-19 13:28:43","No","NORTHSIDE","NORTHSIDE","NORTHSIDE","Never show in sitemap","Full",

The problem was that this particular analyst faced a major nemesis in the bartender who had very little tolerance for Rolling Stones songs on the jukebox.

<p>Here's what separates this act from many other local acts: Comfortably Floyd's social media presence is very strong and growing at a faster pace than any other band in the area with about <strong> 4,000 Facebook fans and over 25,000 video views/hits on YouTube since 2013. </strong></p>
<p>Show promoters are helped out tremendously by the amount of social media and public access available for people to see the high quality of our show that will motivate people to attend. Very rarely, if ever, do any of the top local cover acts play music from Pink Floyd, even though Pink Floyd has sold over 200 million albums. Only The Beatles and Led Zeppelin have sold more rock albums, as local covers of those 2 legendary bands have recently been over-booked in this area. With a very diverse demographic reach, Pink Floyd music is tame enough for elderly audiences while still relevant and recognizable to younger audiences.</p>
<p>Roger Waters, with his tour of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"", was the 2nd highest money-making musician of 2012 with Chicago being the only city in the world that sold out 5 shows. Tribute shows like Australian Pink Floyd and Brit Floyd are some of the world's biggest drawing cover bands because people love to see a Pink Floyd show, and that's why fans turn out to see Comfortably Floyd. The USA longs for a quality Pink Floyd show they can go to see at local festivals and at medium to large sized indoor venues.</p>
<p>As a headliner at a night time show (after dusk), Comfortably Floyd enhances the show with multicolored lasers and a 5000 lumen video projection for multimedia that goes together with the live music. This creates the full Pink Floyd experience that millions long to enjoy. Even with experience and fan appeal as a headliner and also as an opener for major national acts, Comfortably Floyd is a band that will give event planners the most for their money with performances that will be memorable for years to come.</p>","Comfortably Floyd is a Pink Floyd Tribute band show that performs Pink Floyd music with a multimedia video projection and multicolored lasers to create a true Pink Floyd experience.","template.php","default.css","Pink Floyd Tribute Show, Tribute Band, Cover Band, Classic Rock","active","Monthly - Full","2013-02-26 13:08:17","No","Comfortably Floyd","Comfortably Floyd","Comfortably Floyd","Never show in sitemap","Full",

<p>Jin &amp; Tonic Band (JTB) Jin &amp; Tonic Band is one of the premier country bands in the mid-west and has played many of the larger venues in the Chicagoland area, including Joe's on Weed St, House of Blues, The Cubby Bear, Arlington Park Racetrack, River's and Blue Chip Casino. JTB has shared the stage with some of the biggest names in country music today, including Lady Antebellum and The Band Perry.</p>
<p>Jin &amp; Tonic was formed by Jenn Fletcher (""Jin"" - the misspelling is intentional!) and Toni LaManna-Siprut (""Tonic"") in 2005. This seven piece band hosts two female lead singers, two male singers, a fiddle player that will leave you speechless, a pounding rhythm section, and two amazing guitarists featuring their banjo and mandolin skills along the way.</p>
<p>Every Country Song tells a Story, and Jin and Tonic Band does just that, with a show that&rsquo;s One Big Party. Covering the best country music out there and a few surprises along the way. Known for their incredible harmonies and memorizing stage presence, it is a show you won't forget.</p>
<p>Jin &amp; Tonic Acoustic (JTA) Don't have a large enough stage for a 7-piece band? This version of JTB can be scaled to include percussion and bass if the room and budget permits. Jin &amp; Tonic Acoustic delivers a lower key version of the Jin &amp; Tonic Band perfect for smaller rooms or mid-week shows.</p>
<p>Jin &amp; Tonic Band and Jin &amp; Tonic Acoustic can be booked locally and nationally for club &amp; bar gigs, festivals, and private events, including corporate events.</p>","A fun and popular Chicago country band playing great music for good times!!","template.php","default.css","Country,  Cover Band","inactive","Monthly - Full","2013-03-05 15:49:48","No","Gin and Tonic Band","Gin and Tonic Band","Gin and Tonic Band","Never show in sitemap","Full",

<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Amazing!! Green Thirteen was the band at my reception and they truly made my wedding unforgettable. Leading up to the wedding, they were very helpful with the planning - very relaxed yet very organized with awesome planning guides that explained everything. They were super friendly and accommodating throughout the whole process. As far as the reception...THEY ROCKED!! The music was amazing--several guests commented that they felt like they had gone to see an actual band play at a venue! They said, ""I would buy tickets to see this band!!"" The band was also super kid-friendly, allowing some of the younger guests come up and help them ""play"". Months after the wedding, I'm still getting compliments on Green Thirteen. -SARAHDEBJ, 8/13/2011, Review on WeddingChannel.com Green Thirteen - The Perfect Wedding Band. The band will make or break your reception so, if you want a crowd-pleasing, ""dance all night"" band, choose Green Thirteen. They're talented beyond words, fun to work with, professional, and not to mention...affordable!!!! Absolutely everyone loved them. As Mother-of-the-Bride, Patrick instantly appealed to me. ""You seem like one of us"" I kept telling him. My daughter agreed and said Green Thirteen was everything she hoped for and more. We would gladly hire them again! -MRSGREEN 444, 6/17/2011, Review on ""the Knot"" Hello. My wife Allie and I got married at the Blue Heron this summer on June 25. Thanks for everything.

Your talents and exuberance radiated throughout the night. As parents, we truly appreciate all you did to add to the night's success. As artists, you guys rock and are, all in all, pretty awesome! -Ken &amp; Cindy Pavlik, 9/24/11, Wedding Reception, Willowbrook Ballroom IL If we were planning another wedding tomorrow, I'd use you guys again in a heartbeat. You were great! -Nancy Hirsh, 9/18/11, Wedding Reception, Chicago History Museum, IL Green Thirteen was simply incredible. Very few live acts have the energy they have. From the beginning to the end they were the glue that kept our party together. They are THE premier party band in Chicago and provide a great sound and a great time! Thank you...you guys are simply the best! -Emily Ferguson., 9/10/11, Wedding Reception, NIU Campus Naperville When the dance floor is never empty &amp; the house lights come on and nobody wants to leave, you know you had a blast of a band. Green Thirteen provided professional coordination of our event, included the children at our wedding by allowing them to play drums &amp; guitar and kept everyone on the dance floor all night. Camille even made some of our family look good by joining them on the dance floor. We danced more than we have in years. -Hugh &amp; Carolyn, 9/4/11, Wedding Reception, East Bank Club Chicago Green Thirteen promised and over delivered. they were highly professional musicians, organized, flexible, helpful and most importantly personable. Although talent is essential, being able to channel it to meet a variety of musical tastes and make it fun is a difficult task. We couldn't have asked for more...it was a wonderful evening. Eric &amp; Randy Hartwig, 9/3/11, Wedding Reception, Wausau WI THANK YOU!!!! I was blown away by how many people were on the dance floor from the first song. Today is my first day back at work and everyone has told me what a wonderful time they had and even mentioned how versatile the band was. Everyone really enjoyed your music. You guys did a FANTASTIC job! From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU!!!! -Kristen S, 10/16/10, Wedding Reception, OakBrook, IL We hired Green Thirteen for our wedding reception and were absolutely blown away! The performers were very accommodating, handling all of the introductions, and timing for speeches so that I could just sit back and relax. When they started playing live, people crowded the dance floor and didn't leave until the very end of the reception. I had people dancing who I'd never seen on the dance floor before! All in all the music was amazing, I would recommend this band to everyone. It was by far the best wedding I've ever been to, and I owe it to Green Thirteen! -Chrissie G, 1/9/2010, Wedding Reception, Des Plaines, IL Everyone had a great time - nothing but compliments! Their set up looked fantastic and they really made the reception something we will remember for a long time. I even asked Rob to try to make up a new version of our first dance song so it would sound more modern. After hearing it, I think they should record it...it was incredible! Rob even gave us some insight on the hot spots in Mexico for our honeymoon. Music &amp; Travel Planning! Thanks for everything, Rob! I'll report back on the Don Julio 1942 when we get back! -Jackie K, 10/18/2009, Wedding Reception, Streamwood, IL We would like to thank Green Thirteen for playing at our wedding reception and thank Gigmasters for helping us find them! The entire reception was amazing beyond our highest expectations. The dance floor was filled the whole night - even by family members I've never seen leave their seat at a wedding! All we heard the entire night was that we found the best band anyone's ever heard at a wedding. Rob was patient with us and helped us through the whole planning process. He even had the band customize an entire medley for the first dances and it was like something you'd see in a movie. Awesome! Everything flowed together perfectly and extremely professionally. -Erick H, 8/15/2009, Wedding Reception, Glencoe, IL We do this event every year and they raised the bar on what we should expect in a band. They were very helpful with announcements and speeches throughout and their live performance was out of this world. Somehow they went from old to new material all night without ever stopping between songs. Everyone loved them and they wore us out from dancing! -Sarah D, 10/3/2009, Corporate Function, Burlington, WI This band was fantastic. They played for 4 hours with one 15 min. break and never stopped between songs. They were completely professional. There price was reasonably set. If any thing I would think they could ask more. We all had a great night. -Thatcher W, 10/10/2009, Birthday Party (Adults), Wilmette, IL Our company picnic was for 500 people. Everyone enjoyed the music and the band was most helpful. We received a number of compliments about the band and would hire Green Thirteen again. Bill Kay Auto Group -Nina M, 8/10/2008, Corporate Function, Lisle, IL I really had many compliments on the band from guests, and they were very professional, and talented. I would definetly hire them again. They played a wide variety of music to accomadate my guests, and everyone appreciated them. We really had fun! Thanks to Green 13! -Christina K, 10/31/2008, Halloween Party, Berkeley, IL I hired Green Thirteen as entertainment for our high school reunion. I don't organize things like that very often and it took a lot of time and planning. I think the best thing I did was to hire Green Thirteen. As soon as I booked them it was like they lifted a weight off my shoulders. I've never had the opportunity to work with such a talented and professional group of people. I got nothing but rave compliments about them all night. They really made me look great. If you had a rating higher than 5 stars in every category I would give it to them! -John A, 8/22/2009, Reunion, Orland Park, IL Green Thirteen was absolutely brilliant! They were easy to work with and everyone loved them. They even learned a special song for our first dance that a family friend in from Ireland sang with the band. I checked in to some other well known Chicago bands for our wedding and couldn't be happier that I chose Green Thirteen. My wife is an event planner and said that she will be using them for events in the future. -Alan D, 8/27/2010, Wedding Reception, Chicago, IL Green Thirteen was great! The only person not happy was the reception hall manager because nobody wanted to leave! LOL Everything was very professional and fun and the music selection was really great. We even had a few ""wedding crashers"" from other receptions taking place that night who said that they wished they could stay at ours! Great job guys. I'm so glad we found you and we will see you again really soon! -Kathy P, 8/21/2010, Wedding Reception, Kildeer, IL Green Thirteen rocked! They went over all our expectations and our reception kicked a#$! They were very easy to work with and made sure that everything we wanted happened. The bridal party intros were great and they even brought in microphones and speakers for the ceremony which was in the reception hall. I didn't want a cheesy wedding. Green Thirteen was able to make everybody happy and still keep things upbeat and young feeling. I'd recommend them to anyone and we can't wait to go out and see them again soon! -Bobby C, 8/20/2010, Wedding Reception, Chicago, IL I can't thank Green Thirteen enough for playing at our wedding reception! The music was amazing - they somehow went from older songs all the way to Usher and the Black Eyed Peas and sounded amazing on everything. Everyone we talked to had a great time! They were also extremely helpful with the planing for the night and they were really professional and organized as everything unfolded. I put a lot of thought and planning into our reception and after seeing how great everything turned out, the BEST decision I made was to hire Green Thirteen! -Jodi C, 7/10/2010, Wedding Reception, Lake Geneva, WI Everybody LOVED Green Thirteen! They absolutely made our reception. I would recommend this band to anyone who wants a fun dance band that plays a mix of songs for all ages. The sound equipment sounded extremely full and clear, they were a pleasure to work with and we really feel like our wedding meant a lot to them. We feel lucky to have found a band that was easy to work with, reasonably priced and that made our wedding extra special. Thanks guys! -Paige L, 6/12/2010, Wedding Reception, Bloomington, IL Green Thirteen couldn't possibly be more professional, more talented or more fun! The reception was excellent and everyone commented on how great the band was. They were very easy to work with, handled all our requests with ease (they even somehow handled a last minute odd request by my grandmother) and made us feel at ease through the whole day with a sense that they knew exactly what they were doing. The customer service they provided and the ""all-inclusive"" nature of what they provided for us was well worth having them. We are absolutely thrilled that we chose Green Thirteen for our wedding - they were awesome! -Amanda M, 5/22/2010, Wedding Reception, Sauk City, WI</span></p>","The Perfect Wedding Band.","template.php","default.css","Wedding Bands, Cover Bands, Rock Bands","active","Yearly - Full","2013-03-28 19:02:01","No","Green Thirteen","Green Thirteen","Green Thirteen","Never show in sitemap","Full",

The second is the hailed &ldquo;Stop Making Sense Re-Creation,&rdquo; where they perform note-for-note and prop-for-prop the famous Talking Heads concert film from 1984. In 2011, they performed this show to a sold-out crowd at the Vic Theatre in Chicago.</p>
<p>This Must be the Band is extremely happy to play Talking Heads music night after night because the music is just that much fun. Not only has the lead singer (Charlie Otto) been called &ldquo;the illegitimate son of David Byrne,&rdquo; but the band boasts its very own Tina Weymouth (Jamie Jay), Bernie Worrell (Jim Dinou), Adrian Belew (covered by both Otto and Dinou), and Ednah Holt (Kasey Foster). TMBTB is available for any gathering where people need to dance: parties, weddings, bars, etc.</p>","“This Must Be the Band” is Chicago’s only Talking Heads Tribute Band","template.php","default.css","Talking Heads Tribute, Experimental Rock, Cover Band","active","Yearly - Full","2013-04-04 09:42:06","No","This Must Be the Band","This Must Be the Band","This Must Be the Band","Never show in sitemap","Full",

<p>As it&rsquo;s been with many bands for many years, a new band forms then breaks up, re-forms, then breaks up &amp; so on with numerous band name changes in between. Some names stick, &amp; some, well, let&rsquo;s just say, they&rsquo;re better left forgotten.</p>
<p>Our story is not much different. We set out in the summer of 2006 to change the cover band scene &amp; after numerous performances, periodic changes in musical direction &amp; several personnel changes; a new direction was finally established.</p>
<p>Along with professional backing &amp; a focused determination to elevate our music, our shows &amp; provide our audiences with the very best live entertainment experience, 28 Days was formed.</p>
<p>Why 28 Days? We&rsquo;ve heard a number of interesting reasons for the name but the reason was simple, it takes 28 Days to begin the changing of one's behavioral pattern &amp; since we wanted to change the way our audiences viewed the &ldquo;Cover Band&rdquo; scene, seemed like we had a name. 28 days provides audiences with an unparalleled &ldquo;Live&rdquo; experience that electrifies the senses. Members consist of Kevin Triplett on Bass, Joe Maxwell on Guitar, PJ Howard on Drums &amp; Paul Shamoun on Lead Vocals.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s official inception, 28 Days has performed hundreds of events for thousands of screaming fans. For a live entertainment experience you will NOT soon forget, check out 28 Days at a venue near you!</p>

The only rule was that they would only play what they loved. That philosophy continues today and has led Mr. Blotto into unique musical situations.<br /><br /> Mr. Blotto takes the Jam band aesthetic into areas unfamiliar to the standard Jam Scene. They have been known to cover entire albums by Led Zepplin and the Who as well as perform entire shows of Country and Reggae. Artists as diverse as the Grateful Dead, the Flaming Lips, Willie Nelson and The Velvet Underground have seen their material interpreted by Mr. Blotto in the 2000+ shows the band has performed in the last 15 years, yet covers only pepper the bands hefty catalog of original material stemming from five studio albums and other unreleased crowd favorites.</p>

Sometimes bands who've self-released a few EP's try to crank out (and, in effect, stretch out) more of the same formula that came before, somehow hoping for a different result or even recapturing the magic of their first recordings. Others aim for cookie-cutter hits, and still more experiment a bit in an attempt to stand out.
 
In the case of Chicago's The Flips, who had already generated a stellar buzz since last year with the caustic, yet harmonious Damn You & Damn Me Too EP, we get a rare journey with A Harm Deep But Shining in several directions: Vocalist/guitarist Nick Sintos and crew are just as agitated as before, with quiet/loud dynamics bursting into audio explosions, but coupled with that is the allowance of space between Sintos' seething screams and the band's crushing distortion.
 
This is evidenced right from the first track, the aptly named ""Intro,"" as well as ""Racing Stripe"" and the nearly nine-minute ""Bees Knees."" Tempos build, cymbals shimmer with enough air to breathe, and the group  sound right at home taking the proper time needed to reach such memorable climaxes. The mostly acoustic ""Let It Go"" and the swaying ""Cute"" give some stunning spotlights to Sintos' harmonies with keyboardist Annette Nowacki, as well.
 
That's not to say the band is at all at rest. Sintos' trademark howl and Dustin Martin's guitar work are both more powerful than ever. The pummeling ""God I'm Sorry"" packs an emotional punch, along with ""Jawbreaker"" and crunch of ""G-Unit,"" which addresses those who ""play your songs for the sound of the praise."" But this isn't the sound of a band with a chip on their shoulder. Their ferocious output isn't just out there to be heard, but it's the attention they get with it that then opens the listener's mind with what's actually being said.

""One of my favorite lines to describe Johnny Cash is from the book 'Cash' by Rolling Stone magazine: 'Sinner, Saint, Rebel, Voice of Protest, Man of Faith', says Furry, leader of the tribute band Walkin' With Cash. Hailed as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Cash had that rarest of crossover appeals, having earned induction into the Rock n Roll, Country and Gospel Halls of Fame. Furry captures those intricacies with a fan's eagerness and a musician's skill. From his note perfect trembling baritone voice to his all black outfits, every detail rings true during a Walkin' With Cash show. Of course, much of Cash's music, particularly toward the end of his stellar career, focused on moral questions and the search for redemption but Furry's rendition of this often dark and mysterious superstar never translates into a dour, over-serious experience on stage. Instead, Furry delves deep into the Cash catalog shining a spotlight on every corner of this legend-from his rockabilly beginnings to his flirty duets with wife June Carter Cash, expertly recreated in the Walkin' With Cash performances by Jan Daily. It would be hard to portray Johnny Cash and not be somewhat playful and heartwarming, ""He had a wicked sense of humor"" Furry says, ""I'm there to have a good time and it shows"". For the enthusiastic, late-blooming Furry, there's no other way to perform. Furry originally unveiled his imitation of Johnny Cash on a lark and a new passion was born. He was a percussionist and backup vocalist for a local Elvis tribute band, The Blue Suede Crew. ""The lead singer needed a break to change costumes during the show and asked if I knew anyone that could sing like Johnny Cash. I surprised him by belting out ""Folsom Prison Blues"" and that's how I started my tribute to The Man in Black"", Furry remembers. Along with Scott Wattles, as Elvis, The Blue Suede Crew became an almost instant regional draw and even recorded at the legendary Sun Studios in Memphis, TN, birthplace of the mythical careers of both Cash and Presley. Perhaps, inevitably, Furry's star continued to rise and he subsequently established a stand-alone project devoted to The Man in Black called Walkin' With Cash. The group promptly established its own network of fans across the area. ""I try to keep it as true to the original as possible,"" Furry says, ""Cash's musical career was over a 50 year span and we cover as much as possible from the memorable 1954 hit single ""Hey Porter"" to ""Rusty Cage"" (from the Grammy winning 1996 project ""Unchained"") and all the heavy hitters in between.""</p>","<p>Johnny Cash Tribute Band</p>
<p>Cash was a larger than life figure with larger than life faults who loved Jesus and drugs at the same time. He remains one of the only artists to sell over 90 million records. As an inductee of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame, Cash helped bridge the generation gap and break down musical barriers.</p>
<p>Walkin' With Cash is a celebration of the life and music of an American icon and an unforgettable tribute to The Man In Black. Keith's love for this legendary entertainer is obvious throughout his show. Cash left some mighty big shoes to fill but when Keith steps up to the microphone and reveals his deep, booming voice, you will swear Cash is back.</p>","Walkin' With Cash is a celebration of the life and music of American icon Johnny Cash","template.php","default.css","Tribute, Country Band","active","Yearly - Full","2013-06-20 15:55:19","No","Walkin' With Cash","Walkin' With Cash","Walkin' With Cash","Never show in sitemap","Full",

<p>Since the band’s inception in 2009 Red Rebel County has sold out countless shows, been invited to play in front of thousands for various high profile Chicago Police/Fire Department benefits, and packed venues around the Midwest. What began as an excuse for a handful of South Side musicians to get together and play some fun Irish music that defined their musical upbringing, has quickly turned into a nine person ‘tour de force’ that is taking the Midwestern music scene by storm!</p>
<p>Their legion of rabid fans continues to grow rapidly with every show. Covering the pioneers of the bar-room sound, Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly, Red Rebel County plays everyone’s favorite party tunes, along with a handful of traditional Irish bar-room tunes and original music that is guaranteed to have the crowd singing and dancing along with the band.</p>
<p>BUT PARTYGOERS BEWARE – this show isn’t for the faint of heart! Red Rebel County doesn’t put on just any old, ordinary show like most other cover bands. When Red Rebel County rolls through a town the venue is quickly transformed into a huge party with the band playing host as your friendly “MC.” So get ready for loads of drinking, toasting, and fans jumping up on stage to sing and dance along with the band at the next show!</p>
<p>Having received national attention and critical acclaim in their respective original Chicago bands, this group is well versed in bringing both energy and musicianship to their live shows. From the bag pipers, to the banjo and the fiddle that will have you dancing along, Red Rebel County puts on a MUST SEE show for music lovers everywhere! Be sure to check them out when the party hits your town! So get ready to raise your glass in a toast, sing and dance along to a song (or ten,) and you’ll have a blast with Red Rebel County…guaranteed!</p>"," 'Tour de force’ that is taking the Midwestern music scene by storm!","template.php","default.css","Cover band, Irish party rock, wedding band, festival band","active","Yearly - Full","2013-06-28 11:41:16","No","Red Rebel County","Red Rebel County","Red Rebel County","Never show in sitemap","Full",

In fall 2007, his beatbox harmonica video became the number one video on YouTube. This led to live beatbox performances at Google parties around the world, several commercials and the formation of a YouTube community bound by beatbox. When the economic crash led to a slowdown in sponsored appearances, Yuri began work on , a personal journey through the world of YouTube celebrity that confronts issues of authenticity, originality, and self-image through beatbox and live video performance. MeTube premiered at the Chicago Humanities Festival in spring 2010. Yuri hopes to touch just a fraction of his 15 million (but who's counting) YouTube fans with a live show in realtime. He is currently working on 2nd album and a new beatbox show for kids about water.</p>","<p>I'm a world renown beatbox performer known around the internet World for playing harmonica and beatboxing at the same time.</p>
<p>Yuri Lane was born on a small island in Holland. His parents, a painter and a violinist, soon moved to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district to ride the 70's counter-culture current. Raised in the Haight, Yuri learned rhythm by osmosis and began to breathe beats In the 80's, Yuri started breakdancing and teaching moves at middle school parties. He discovered his true passion in a sixth grade math class where Yuri made sounds to compensate for his lack of skill in arithmetic. When his teacher ordered him to ""turn off the radio,"" Yuri knew that he was on to something. Yuri spent his teenage years on stage at theaters like San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater and Berkeley Repertory Theater while attending high school at the San Francisco School of the Arts. After finishing a theater degree at the Pacific Conservatory for the Performing Arts, Yuri returned to San Francisco to pursue mime, improvisation and alternative theatrical forms.</p>
<p>During the dot-com boom, Yuri found himself as ""the geek"" in several local and national commercials as well as in TV episodes As San Francisco's boom went bust, Yuri returned to theater and began developing his one-man human beatbox musicalSoundtrack City. Yuri created Soundtrack City by performing one scene at a time at clubs, bars, coffee shops, and small theaters of San Francisco. The full-length production of Soundtrack City debuted in November 2001, with runs in San Francisco and New York in 2002 and a run in Chicago in 2005. Soundtrack City chronicled the transformation of urban neighborhoods during gentrification.</p>
<p>With his partner Sharif Ezzat and his wife Rachel Havrelock, Yuri created ""the coolly extraordinary"" From Tel Aviv to Ramallah, a hip-hop play that tackles the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.From Tel Aviv to Ramallah steers clear of ideology in order to show the daily lives of young people during the Second Intifada. From Tel Aviv to Ramallah had its world premiere at Theater J in Washington DC in 2003, where it was nominated for a Helen Hayes Award for best new play. The show enjoyed runs in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore and Atlanta. It toured across the US at theaters, campuses, and peace events. International venues include Helsinki, London and Jerusalem.</p>

But most of all, the 70's was an era of great rock & roll! ​We play not only excellent music from the era, but bring a fun, high energy show complete with great musicianship, 70's era wardrobe, and audience participation.</p>
<p>Your customers and/or guests can't help but get up, dance, drink and have a good time. ​8-Track is truly unique in that we play rock tunes only from the 1970's. Music that no other band is playing from bands like Foghat, Aerosmith, Mountain, Nazareth, Grand Funk, Kiss, AC/DC, Alice Cooper, Lynyrd Skynyrd, UFO and Van Halen.</p>
<p>Our resume includes headlining at major clubs such as Austin's Fuel Room, Cubby Bear North and Tilted Kilt (Elgin); being selected as the opening act for legendary bands UFO and Nazareth by promoter Ron Onesti at the Arcada Theater (St. Charles); special performances at Toyota Park, Blarney Island and Cubby Bear (Wrigleyville); and municipal events/festivals including Lisle's Eyes to the Skies, River Grove's Gazebo concert series and Kenilworth's Beach Bash. ​We enjoy being true entertainers who engage and interact with our audiences, and we always play for – rather than to – the crowd.</p>","With platform shoes, bell bottom pants, and polyester shirts, 8-Track is a Chicago band that will take you back to the 70’s.","template.php","default.css","Cover Band, Rock Band, Tribute Band","active","Monthly - Full","2013-09-27 17:20:06","No","8-Track: The Ultimate 70s Rock Show","8-Track: The Ultimate 70s Rock Show","8-Track: The Ultimate 70s Rock Show","Never show in sitemap","Full",

<p>Greg Fulton (formerly of Cyclone Temple and Znowhite) left Chicago and his band &ldquo;Rebels Without Applause&rdquo; for Memphis in pursuit of a fresh start and a new life. As a creature of habit, he played in smoky bars and juke joints until the day he met Simon Sunchess, a local club record producer.</p>
<p>Sunchess and the deal he offered seemed legitimate at the time, but Fulton soon realized that it was all smoke and mirrors. After months of dodging Sunchess and his offers, Fulton realized that he no longer wanted to stay in Memphis. Fulton returned to Chicago and as soon as he hit the city limits, he began making phone calls and putting together the hottest band he could find.</p>
<p>Upon hatching his plan, he gave Courtney, Andy, and Rodney the blueprint for Sweet Diezel Jenkins. With the new band set and the plan in motion, Sweet Diezel Jenkins mashes up hits of yesterday and today, adding a heavy hand of backyard feel good party vibe with a dash of gritty juke joint smoky goodness. Using a range of artists from Usher and Kings of Leon, to the Stones and James Brown, the Sweet Diezel Jenkins blueprint was brought to life. It&rsquo;s gonna be a party y&rsquo;all!</p>

In the relatively short amount of time that the band has been together, they have covered thousands of miles, winning over fans and venues in every town they've played. In the past year, they have shared stages with the likes of Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band, Steep Canyon Rangers, Town Mountain, Jesco White, Spirit Family Reunion, Dom Flemons of The Carolina Chocolate Drops and many others. They have been invited to many festivals and events in the region, including Buckle Up, Whispering Beard Folk Festival, Duck Creek Log Jam, Paddlefest, Taste of Cincinnati and more. Being from Cincinnati has afforded them the luxury of being within a couple hours of many other cities that have their own vibrant music scenes. The band hits the road every chance they get. They are currently averaging 12 to 15 shows a month, and show no signs of slowing down. Every time they return to a town, the crowds get bigger, more CDs end up in the hands of fans, and word of mouth spreads even further.

",,"Honey & the 45s is a Chicago based soul/rock band featuring two female front-women.  Known for its dynamite stage performance and soulful/jazz undertones, the band was originally formed as an acoustic group by lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Kristina Cottone, and singer, violinist and saxophonist Kim Kozel.  Honey & the 45s’ unique sound has evolved into a soulful rock ‘n’ roll band by adding lead guitarist Jon Gould and bassist Sean Tatum.

Honey & the 45s’ debut album, The Need, was released in September of 2012.  Five of the tracks off The Need  were remixed by Grammy-Award nominated engineer Fred Breitberg and have been played on over 100 radio stations nationwide.  

In 2014, the band was awarded Best Blues/Jazz Band at the Chicago Independent Music Awards, and went on to open on the main stage for Cold War Kids at the Rock ‘N’ Roll Marathon in Chicago and Big Data in St. Louis. Honey & the 45s has been featured in print, on commercials, in press conferences and has performed at some of the most prestigious music festivals and venues in Chicago and the Midwest. Honey’s most recent live television performance aired nationally in December 2014 on WGN, coinciding with the release of the band’s second album, MAD. 

Honey’s fresh album, MAD, has received critical acclaim, and the band recently released the music video for “Dark” from that album.  In 2015, Honey and the 45s continues to play at its favorite venues around Chicago and tour regionally.  The band opened earlier this year for Smash Mouth in North Carolina, Andy Grammer in Grant Park in Chicago, and most recently, for Eric Hutchinson in St. Louis. 


Reviews: 


""Honey & the 45s combine the low-fi sonics of eighties punk, the gorgeous rolling cadences of seventies R&B, and the infectious hooks of sixties pop.  As whip smart as the lyrics are, the music itself is even better.” – Robert Rodi, New City Music 

“This five-piece is steered by the sweet-dripping vocals of Kristina Cottone and the on-the-one harmonies of violinist/saxophonist Kim Kozel.  For a band that’s only been together for a few years, they sound like they’ve been mastering their craft and living their songs for a decade or two.” - Rob Ross, Pop Dose,

 “They have a way of making the genres of jazz, funk, and blues sound fresh and completely new, as if the band is introducing each style to their audience for the first time.” - Listen Here Reviews

 “A stellar set of seven songs that seamlessly weaves genres like rock, soul, jazz and blues, ultimately telling the story of a passionate group that wants more than just success.” - Chicago at Night, by Jim Ryan

 “It is quite difficult to not be entranced in the unreal qualities of Honey & the 45s.  If they continue to produce even a percentage of the sound they achieved with Mad there is nothing that can hold this band back.  I can’t think of a better record to kick off the year.” - Greg Shaw, Nanobot Rock Reviews

Or you&rsquo;re into <strong>country-rock</strong> bands like the Eagles or Pure Prairie League. Your ears pricked up when you discovered <strong>alt-country</strong> or <strong>insurgent country</strong> bands like Son Volt or Whiskeytown or Steve Earle &amp; the Dukes. You listen to <strong>rockin&rsquo; country</strong> bands like Little Big Town or Pistol Annies, or <strong>&rdquo;Americana&rdquo;</strong> artists like the Lumineers (&ldquo;Hey Ho&rdquo;) or the Decemberists (&ldquo;Down by the Water&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If your tastes run toward the intersection of country and rock music, you will love Twangdogs, a Chicago-based country/Americana band whose motto is: ""Country, rock 'n' roll -- and everything in between."" The band plays a satisfying stew of old-time rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll (Buddy Holly, Creedence Clearwater Revival), contemporary country (Little Big Town and Pistol Annies) and twang-inflected songs drawn from artists as diverse as Warren Zevon, Old Crow Medicine Show, the Grateful Dead and the Rolling Stones. With five singers in the band, Twangdogs are known for their vocal harmonies.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a musical thread that ties Twangdogs&rsquo; show together, it runs through the many places where American country music crossed paths with rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll &mdash; whether that&rsquo;s Lubbock, Texas (Buddy Holly), El Cerrito, California (CCR), Nashville, Tennessee (Little Big Town) or Cincinnati, Ohio (Pure Prairie League). The band also reaches beyond the U.S. to incorporate tunes from artists such as Kathleen Edwards (Canada) and Richard Thompson (the UK).</p>
<p>Since early 2012, Twangdogs have been playing regularly around Chicago, impressing audiences with their muscular sound and harmonious vocals. They released their first CD, ""Live From the Lost Artists Show,"" in early 2014. They&rsquo;d love to entertain you!</p>","Twangdogs are a Chicago-based country/Americana band","template.php","default.css","Country, Rock, Cover","inactive","Yearly - Full","2014-01-18 13:02:31","No","Twangdogs","Twangdogs","Twangdogs","Never show in sitemap","Full",

Kampfire Kowboys consists of five highly experienced musicians. If you like smokin’ guitars and fired up fiddles, this is the band for your event! There’s no slowing down with this band. It starts with a bang and leaves you wanting more.

Lead vocalist/guitarist Tom Colton founded the band in 1999 and produced two full length CD’s at that time to rave local revues. In 2010, he put together a new band using the Kampfire Kowboys name and introduced a new dynamic line-up that plays all your favorite current and classic country songs.

In addition to Colton’s high-energy guitar licks and smooth vocals, he added veteran fiddle player Ray Henaughan. Ray has played with numerous country bands in the last 20 years, most notably Workin Class Band, which played hundreds of clubs and festivals all around Chicago-land.  WCB was the 1997 Wisconsin State Champion in the True Value/Jimmy Dean Foods Country Showdown, the largest country talent competition in the world. They were also nominated for ""Best Country Artist of the Year"" in the Chicago Music Awards two years in a row. Ray is also known as the guy with the big white hat and you should hear him perform Charlie Daniels!

Adding more energy than ever before, Dave Piper returns to the band as the “man on the bass.”  In the past, you’ve seen him play with Kampfire Kowboys as the original bassist.  Dave also performed with Big Guitars from Memphis for 8 years. If you know Dave, you know he’s all smiles and invites everyone into his world. Music is his best friend!

Just recently the Kowboys added vocalist Kevin McCarthy on lead vocals and guitar.  Kevin adds a new vocal dimension to the band.  An excellent vocalist, his rendition of Zac Brown is amazing to hear, not to mention his performances covering Darius Rucker and many other artists. Kevin also contributes his vocal skills by adding more profound vocal harmonies to the band.

How do you firm up a country band and place the cherry on top?  You add a dynamic drummer to the mix.  Rich Lavin plays that role perfectly.  Coming to us direct from the band ""Hooked on Sonics,"" Rich Lavin is an amazing drummer.  ""He can play anything!""  This south paw is somthing to see live.  Very energetic and in complete control and he provides the thunder with the lightning.

Tell us what you want!

The band performs many different artists, including The Mavericks, Dwight Yoakam, Johnny Cash, and more modern country like Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, Jason Aldean, Dierks Bentley, Justin Moore and The Zac Brown Band. Kampfire Kowboys also performs fiddle classics such as Charlie Daniels’ Devil Went Down to Georgia and Orange Blossom. 

Tell us what you want.  New country, classic country, maybe a little classic rock or a little of everything.  We aim to please because we'll accommodate to whatever you want.

Kampfire Kowboys is perfect for your club, festival, corporate or party needs. Just remember to clear the dance floor when they take the stage because it’s foot-stompin’ time!

Kampfire Kowboys are:
Tom Colton – Lead Vocals/Lead Guitar
Kevin McCarty - Lead Vocals/Guitar
Ray Henaughan – Fiddle/Vocals

Combine a Syrian heart with Midwestern soul to find Bassel Almadani commanding the microphone with passion so intense that it will send shivers down your spine. No stranger to adversity himself, Bassel's ties to his family abroad remain stronger than ever as they endure an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria. The soulful music of Bassel & The Supernaturals draws a deep connection between the ongoing chaos in his parents' homeland and his personal experiences growing up in the US. Despite a series of challenges in Bassel's personal life since 2010 - including a massive house fire, the theft of his automobile, and a handful of bone fractures - his focus on global awareness and charity has never been greater. In addition to performing in clubs and festivals across the nation, Bassel has partnered with universities and charity organizations nationwide to host seminars, workshops, and benefit concerts drawing attention to the crisis in Syria along with issues related to Arab/Muslim-American hostility in the US.


""Bassel Al-Madani doesn't want audiences to just have a good time getting down at shows. He wants fans to leave Bassel & the Supernaturals shows with a sense of connection and, perhaps, new political awareness. The 25-year-old bandleader of the contemplative indie-funk ensemble is first-generation Syrian-American and has been using the band's shows and releases to benefit humanitarian efforts in war-torn Syria.""

-- Chicago Tribune


Born and raised in the college town of Kent, Ohio, Bassel naturally gravitated towards music and social engagement during his childhood. He began playing the violin at the age of 10, and shifted his focus to drumming a few years later. Fueled by his enthusiasm for songwriting, he picked up a guitar and began writing and performing his own music in 2003. Less than a year later he developed a unique method of playing guitar in an open tuning (with no A-string) which has defined his performance style on stage for over a decade.

Bassel's Buckeye roots were cemented in 2006 when he relocated to Columbus, Ohio to study business at The Ohio State University. His first studio effort as a songwriter was independently released as a self-titled EP (2008) and features the production talents of Ahmed Gallab - aka Sinkane - who has performed in Yeasayer, Caribou, Of Montreal, and Born Ruffians. Bassel's second studio production, ""Submerged"" (2010), was independently released as an LP and showcased his skills on several different instruments in tandem with local artists across Ohio. After graduating with degrees in both Logistics Management and International Business, he embarked on a 3-week solo tour to promote his new record. Upon its completion and during his relocation to Chicago to begin a new corporate job, Bassel was invited to perform in the Pelotonia opening ceremony with The Counting Crows & Augustana in the ride against cancer.

Shuffling back and forth between Chicago and Ohio after long work days and weekends quickly led to the official formation of Bassel & The Supernaturals. With a rapidly growing presence in Chicago and across the Midwest, the band released their latest ""Dreamer"" EP (2013) at the Empty Bottle in Chicago. The vinyl release funded a 3-week tour across the US along with humanitarian donations to victims in Syria.

They have since performed with national acts on stages of all shapes and sizes across the US, including Brother Ali, Aesop Rock, Kimya Dawson, Jessica Hernandez & The Deltas, and many others. Most recently Bassel was featured in the Abreaction 2 exhibition in Brooklyn, New York alongside international artists who have a family history in refugee, revolution, civil war, or genocide in the Middle East. Bassel & The Supernaturals also recently debuted their ""Loft Sessions"" live video series, showcasing four new original compositions that will be featured on their upcoming album in 2015.

Nothing has been able to stop Bassel & The Supernaturals from going against the odds to pursue their passion for music, and they don't plan on stopping any time soon. They are instrumental to the neo-soul movement, and they are putting the Midwest and the Middle East back on the map.","high energy mix of originals and covers","template.php","default.css","Soul, Jazz, Funk, Rock","active","Yearly - Full","2014-02-05 11:26:44","No","Bassel & The Supernaturals","Bassel & The Supernaturals","Bassel & The Supernaturals","Never show in sitemap","Full",

Percussive Guitar Instrumentals - Jim St. James","'Jordans & James' aka, The Modern Day Troubadours, are an Americana / folk rock duo from the Midwest comprised of musicians Jim St. James and Zkott Jordans.

Jim St. James, originally from Gary, Indiana, has released 6 cds of original material since coming onto the Nashville singer songwriter scene in 1998.  His single 'Caroline' from the solo album 'the naked i' previously charted at #1 on the Roots Music Report's Roots charts (RMR) and in January 2015, his song about the life of Amelia Earhart has been featured on the official website of the famous aviatrix.

Zkott Jordans is a talented young guitarist and singer songwriter from LaPorte, Indiana. With a background in rock, jazz performance, flamenco & gypsy jazz via Indiana University, his unique playing style is a cornucopia of genre blends, adding a refreshing sound to the duo's arrangements.

After over 500 live performances in the Southwest, Midwest and Gulf Coast, all while living and touring out of an old Lincoln limousine, the two singer songwriters have combined forces to become known as 'Jordans & James.'

In addition to their many original compositions, the duo performs popular cover songs that have been picked to satisfy any audience. From Johnny Cash to the Allman Brothers, John Prine to Jim Croce, Jimmy Buffet to blues, country and rock... their live show is fun, energetic and always a good time! 

Their new EP, 'Modern Day Troubadours', is slated for release this spring, 2016.

","Kingery’s first full album release is built on big sounds and diverse styles that aim to please and keep you wondering where it will go next. The ambitious recording is used as a great back drop for the positive lyrics of vocalist John Kush. Ed Jenke (Guitars) and Gene Jenke (Bass & Synths) challenge each other with winding rhythms & solos that chase and challenge each other to the outer limits. Mike Tucker (Drums) holds down the beat and keeps everyone in line. Kingery’s emerging vision is one to look forward to and lose yourself in.  Please visit www.Kingeryband.com for all other info!

When drummer Dave Baboorian (Sacrament, Dead Nugget's Dish) and guitarist Eric McWhorter (project.44, Salamander Red) met in college, they began a friendship cultivated from the mutual admiration of innovative music. Occasionally sharing a stage over the course of the next several years while engaged separately in their own projects, they settled into a regular lab session to explore a more avant-garde and experimental flavor of music than that of which they had previously partaken. This rather unstructured period yielded a platform on which to base a common musical understanding, spurring them to reform the more loosely bound elements of their periodic experimentation into something they could bring to the people. During this transitional period, many of those who had previously enjoyed the more relaxed atmosphere of the more recreational side of the project fell away. One man who held fast to the accelerating body which was soon to become Modiviccan was bassist Korey McWilliams, who brought a solid groove to what had then become a trio. The members faced their uncertain future with a driving will to succeed, doing whatever it took to continue growing the seed which had been planted so long before. As Modiviccan took its first breaths in 2010, Eric began penning lyrics which would ultimately steel his resolve to become a workable front man. As songs began to take shape from the wreckage of the riffs and phrases of their past experimentation, the gentlemen began to draw up schematics for the work that lie ahead of them. Following the recording sessions for their first EP at Sviteknology Studios in early 2012, the triumverate of musicians turned their collective eye toward playing out. Around this time, Eric rekindled a once-lost relationship with guitarist Chris Zurawic (Iris, DJ Abstraxis), with whom he had previously joined forced for a few brief weeks as co-axers in Salamander Red. Chris had been engaged in capturing a darker strain of electronica which had been seeping through his pores, and had been entertaining the idea of rehearsal spot cohabitation with another project. Once together in a common venue, the four musicians fell in together for the occasional collaboration. This grew into a formal amalgamation in 2014, allowing the nascent Modiviccan to thicken their live sound and broaden their range. This new incarnation is now in the studio to capture this new sound into a new EP. As Modiviccan continues to grow their fan base and share their talents in venues around the city, they welcome collaborative efforts from rapper Kilo P. Greedy of Crucial Conflict and violinist Shant Mahserejian. Always looking to burst boundaries, these fellows are an ensemble you won't want to miss and will have a hard time forgetting.</p>","Some things cannot be rushed.

BIO:
Elle Casazza diversifies the pop scene with her own refreshing and authentic blend of jazz, soul, funk and pop rhythms that are seamlessly crafted into her songs. Elle’s commanding vocals, defying songwriting and versatile approach produces infectious and timeless music that garners fans worldwide.

The re-creative and contemporary singer-songwriter showcases her retro-pop style in her latest record, Proof. The album was released at the end of 2016 and contains the lead pop-funk single and video, “Too Bad.” Elle Casazza gears up for her second release and music video entitled, “You.” The new track is a rousing love ballad highlighting a devoted relationship that is continuously endless. Casazza’s impassioned vocals lead us into an empowering bridge that carries out the song with a full band and harmonic back-up vocals.

“Writing ‘You’ was writing a promise to myself, Elle notes. After a tumultuous and emotional night, the first verse just poured out of me. It’s not only a love ballad to that someone special in my life, but to myself as well.”

Proof explores a variety of genres that display Elle Casazza’s creative depth and musical diversity. The full-length features 1960’s soul influenced singles such as “Hey” and “Cooking” as well as, tracks like “Save Me” that contain funk-rock and jazz fusion elements. Elle cohesively blends a wide range of musical expressions that smoothly unfold as the record continues. With her latest album Proof, Elle hopes to “deliver authenticity by bringing the live band back to pop music,” she says.

Hailing from Chicago, Elle began singing and performing when she was eight years old. After learning how to play the piano and guitar, it wasn’t until college when she started writing her own music. Elle’s eclectic lyrical style has been considerably influenced by classic artists such as Amy Winehouse, No Doubt, Stevie Wonder and Queen.

Casazza’s songwriting process stems from personal experiences that narrow into particular themes and narratives where she can openly express herself. Her sincere and unapologetic songwriting oozes with passion and illuminates an engaging listening experience. Her powerful and silk-like vocals are complimented by retro-pop elements that bring her personal stories to life.

In May 2013, Elle Casazza made her recording debut with her EP, For Your Pleasure. In 2015, she released three stirring singles “Witness,” “Rainy Days” and “Soft & Low” which received media praise from Paste Magazine, Midwest Action, WLUW’s Radio One show in Chicago and more.

Elle Casazza has performed at some of Chicago’s premier venues such as Concord Music Hall, Martyrs, Mayne Stage and many others.  Performing either solo or with her five-piece band; Elle delivers an energetically live show that showcases her heartfelt and compelling vocals along with contemporary instrumental grooves. Elle continues to add additional tour dates to support her latest release, Proof.","Fearless, sultry and powerful, just a few words to describe Elle Casazza.

PJ began playing bass guitar at the age of 8 years old. His cousin bought a bass guitar and a keyboard for his son to play. He did not take to it and passed it on to PJ. While PJ was practicing with his cousins, PJ realized that he could play by ear. This was the beginning of a beautiful thing for PJ. While PJ was attending Hugh Manley High School in Chicago, he learned to read music and to go on and sharpen his bass playing skills. In his sophomore year PJ was selected to be a part of Manley’s Jazz band. From there PJ was selected to be the bass player for The Chicago All-City Jazz Band from 1984 to 1987. During this time PJ received numerous awards which include “The Outstanding Soloist Award” at the Midwest Jazz Festival and “Outstanding Musician of the Year” from All City Jazz Band of Chicago. After High school PJ started playing professionally around the Chicago area and Gospel recording artist Rev. Jessy Dixon approached me and asked me to become the full-time bass player for him and his choir. It was Rev. Dixon, who taught PJ showmanship and how to be a professional musician. This position provided PJ with the opportunity to perform with the talents of Andre and Sandra Crouch, Kurt Carr and Abraham Laboriel. Currently PJ working with his new project “PJ & Soul” and just finished a CD to be release in November 2014. PJ also is touring the USA and abroad with Rodney Sir Nose Trotter as Bass Player and Musical Director. When not touring PJ is doing clinics and studio sessions. PJ’s goal is to enjoy Life simply to have fun! </p>

From heart-stirring ballads to hip shaking soul jams, this band will leave you with a tear in your eye and sweat at your feet.

Praise for The Congregation:

""The Congregation makes its debut with a formidable full-length filled with churchy soul and jazzy rock...this eight-piece ensemble arrives in the wake of buzz surrounding some other old-school contemporaries, Alabama Shakes. The Congregation's Gina Bloom, though, is a different kind of singer -- more eager, mischievous, alluringly androgynous...The band, too, is nimble and highly caffeinated, applying gospel grooves (the title track) as easily as slinky sugar-daddy lovin' (""High Class""). Yes, they can get my amen!"" -- Thomas Conner, Chicago Sun-Times

""The sound is soul music on fire, touched by the blues, and wrapped up in the energy of rock and roll; it is completely infectious! It is the kind of sound that reminds us all how powerful live music can be."" -- Mike O'Cull, Chicago Blues Guide

“Led by vocalist Gina Bloom, whose bluesy pipes and aching timbres carry over her dapperly dressed band's rhythm section, The Congregation unapologetically hearken back to an era when music stands, brassy call-and-response lines and disciplined performances graced every concert stage. The wild card? Sass."" -- Bob Gendron, Chicago Tribune, ""11 Bands to Watch in 2011""

“There just aren't many singers in Chicago that can own a room the way that The Congregation frontwoman Gina Bloom can; her voice is just that great. The 8-piece garage-soul band packs a lot of attitude and charisma into their set.” -- Matt Pais, RedEye

""With a modern and vibrant take on soul music and the powerful vocals of Gina Bloom, The Congregation released a new instant classic in 2012 in the form of their full-length debut ""Right Now Everything."" The eight-piece band sports its own horn section in addition to keyboards, piano, guitar, drums (lots of drums). This is original gospel soul mix in an indie rock form, i.e. what critics love about Alabama Shakes, but so much more authentic."" -- The Deli Magazine","Dynamic rock and soul band from Chicago.","template.php","default.css","Soul, R&B, Blues, Rock","active","Yearly - Full","2015-01-07 11:58:21","No","The Congregation","The Congregation","The Congregation","Never show in sitemap","Full",

We have covered The Beatles, Eric Clapton, Wings, Black Sabbath, Aretha Franklin, Huey Lewis, Joe Cocker, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Daft Punk, Umphrey's McGee, Paul Simon, JJ Cale, Guns and Roses, etc.</p>","<p>JJ &amp; Dre initially formed in Chicago, IL as a trio in 2011 when the husband and wife duo of Justin and Andrea Dotoli met guitarist Jason Paradise at the city's storied Vic Theater. The trio quickly found a strong chemistry, began working up original material and spent most of 2011 performing in and around the greater Chicagoland area before locking in its full lineup of Eric Allen, Mike Schroeder and Andy Neel on keyboards, drums and bass respectively, in 2012. The potent combination of numerous songwriters, vocalists and styles quickly created a musical stew of sorts, in turn sparking a creative surge that shows no signs of slowing down. This is proven by the fact that JJ &amp; Dre has released a full length LP (2012&rsquo;s One Single Event) and two EP&rsquo;s (2013&rsquo;s The Bandits and 2014&rsquo;s Clark) over the course of the next three years. The band has become a musical amalgamation of Rock, Blues, Funk and Soul and while they&rsquo;re all clearly experienced and capable as a studio unit, the live stage is where they&rsquo;re truly at their best.</p>","Chicago Rock and Roll Band","template.php","default.css","Chicago Rock and Roll","active","Yearly - Full","2015-01-26 08:44:51","No","JJ & Dre","JJ & Dre","JJ & Dre","Never show in sitemap","Full",

Whether its bandmates, family or those he teaches music to nearly 50 times a week, Hayes continues to mature, learn and balloon his talents. He's that rare performer where referring to his sound as a constant work-in-progress isn't a detriment, but a selling point.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>It took Hayes quite a bit of time to take music seriously, as the Rockford native quit piano lessons twice at the ages of 5 and 10, convincing himself he'd play first base for the Cubs instead. ""I always had a good ear for music though and it wasn't until junior college that I decided to buy a guitar and become a musician,"" recalls Hayes. ""My boss at a construction site was a great guitarist, and he taught me some classic rock songs and riffs from the Beatles and Rolling Stones. I also started to take theory classes and private piano and classical guitar lessons at Rock Valley College.""</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>He transferred to Columbia College in 2001, and it's from here on that Hayes began to meet those he could make music with for years to come, but more often than not, Hayes was joining&nbsp;bands instead of leading them (such as Chuck's Electric and Audio 55). ""For a while, I tried to find myself musically. Having learned a bunch of genres at school, and wanting to play a bunch of them prolonged it, I think,"" mentions Hayes. ""It took a while for me to be OK with repeating myself, which would turn into my sound. I also spent a lot of time learning and trying to get better. Getting back into music late in my life was a cause for that. But this is why I love teaching, I got to keep on learning. I started maturing and getting better."" Recording Christmas-themed songs also ""helped me become a better arranger and re-arranger of music.""</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Hayes' brother died in 2010, shortly before Hayes had asked to borrow money from him to master his debut album&nbsp;<em>In With The Old</em>. This life event heavily influenced his second release,&nbsp;<em>Out With The New</em>&nbsp;(2012) but due to band members having children and settling down in new houses, Hayes was unable to play many shows in support of the album.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>This year, Hayes is back with&nbsp;<em>Epics</em>, a wildly-eclectic batch of sonic wizardry and emotional highs. His McCartney influence is pleasantly apparent on cuts like ""Backwards"" and ""Persistent Memory,"" while Led Zeppelin and The Doors get nods on the hectic and crushing ""Crazy.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;Some songs even deal with, or involve, local law enforcement. The blazing rocker ""Paranoid"" covers being called (and eventually pulled over) by Chicago Police, being asked if he murdered someone earlier - his car's make and model matched the description of a suspect's - and the recording of instant classic ""Black"" even drew the cops to the studio: ""I guess Lakeview didn't appreciate the loud power chords at&nbsp;<span data-term=""goog_522344025""><span>midnight</span></span>,"" jokes Hayes, who mentions a window being open at the studio leading to a run-in with police.&nbsp;""I looked up during mid-take to see the police in front of me. I raised my finger saying 'One second,' and continued the take. We were scared shitless, They asked us to stop and left. The adrenaline was pumping after that, and there were other magic moments when recording this album.</p>","Rock band and solo acoustic act.","template.php","default.css","Rock, Indie, Singer Songwriter, Acoustic","active","Yearly - Full","2015-01-28 12:28:07","No","David Hayes Project","David Hayes Project","David Hayes Project","Never show in sitemap","Full",

Their music, fresh rock riffs with melodic overtones and pop-inspired hooks, is both fun and engaging. Featuring a little rock, pop, and blues, Last Second Drop brings new and exciting rock to Chicago's local music arena. Last Second Drop formed as The Hooks in February of 2010 when Adam Braverman returned to Chicago and reunited with his friend and long-time collaborator, Ashish (Ash) Davé. Ash and Adam had worked with each other previously as members of the Three Wisemen, a Chicago-based blues-rock band that actively performed throughout the city from 2005 – 2007. With the desire to branch out from the blues and move towards creating a more original sound, Ash introduced Adam to Josh Cantor, a local Chicago singer-songwriter. Adam, Ash and Josh shared the same musical vision: to write fun and engaging songs that make people move. They began working on original songs immediately. With Adam and Josh playing guitar, singing and writing most of the material, and Ash anchoring the music with tasteful bass lines, there was still one piece missing from the puzzle. That piece fell into place when Adam suggested that his good friend Miles Fox audition on the drums. Miles' natural talent and energy made him the perfect fit to drive the band's percussion end. In 2013, a switch was made and Chris Losacco came on board to handle the vocal vibes. The dynamic power and tone-filled growl of Chris' vocals fit ""The Drop"" sound perfectly. Collectively, the members of LSD have a wealth of performance experience under their belts. In addition to playing at notable Chicago venues such as the famous The House of Blues, The Metro, Lincoln Hall, The Cubby Bear, The Elbo Room, Double Door, Buddy Guy's Legends, U.S. Cellular Field, The Wisefool's Pub, The Tonic Room, Reggies Live, The Ivy, The Union Bar, The Store, Sylvie's Lounge ,and the famous Drinkin' on Lincoln Pub Crawl and Guiness OysterFest. LSD musicians have performed in bars and clubs in Albuquerque, Colorado, Utah, Austin, Huntington Beach, DC, and across the world in Taipei, Taiwan and Mumbai, India. With music as diverse as their backgrounds, Last Second Drop provide their audience with a unique listening experience: a bit rock, a bit blues, and a bit pop. Their lyrics tell stories of love, loss, relationships and life, while their music twists and turns through improvisational highs and lows. After all, what is good music without a good Drop?</p>

Sample of artists covered: Prince, Michael Jackson, Al Green, Drake, Bill Withers, Justin Timberlake, Rolling Stones and more</p>","<p>From solo acoustic, acoustic trio, or full band, Aryk Crowder has a variety of adaptable performance options. With originals and covers ranging from Prince, Eric Clapton,Justin Timberlake, Drake, Michael Jackson, and more, Aryk's Chicago made Soul and Rock can be the right sound to your event.</p>
<p>Long before this year's first volume of his 2x4 EP series, everything about Chicago R&amp;B/soul sensation Aryk Crowder has been about building a sturdy, tangible structure on which his unique vision can thrive. From his early four-track recordings in a studio apartment to recent grass-roots efforts in crowd-sourcing and charity work to the hand-stamped artwork and distribution of 2x4 to a new video centered on local tragedy (""One By One,"" coming this November), it's all innovative, creative and certainly DIY, but Crowder's ethic also hearkens back to a time before DIY was hip or underground. With his own two hands, Crowder isn't building walls in order to stand-out, so much as bridges. After months of perfecting his demo in the late 00's, Crowder began his quest for success in the heart of Chicago. The city&rsquo;s local music scene eagerly opened its arms to its newest musician. Soon after arriving, he had booked live performances at some of the city&rsquo;s most prominent venues, many of which he continues to be requested back to, such as the House of Blues, Reggie's, Hard Rock Cafe, Subterranean, Martyrs' and Uncommon Ground. Whether solo or joined by his infections live band - bassist Adrian Morris, drummer Will Nickson and keyboardist Brandon Mckenzie - Crowder has wow'd audiences as an opener for New Kids on the Block's Jordan Knight and singer/songwriter Mat Kearney, as well as at a sold-out, debut appearance at Angels &amp; Kings (owned by Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz). Crowder has also racked up several stunning live on-air performances on WGN 720AM, WBEZ 91.5FM, Vocalo 90.7FM and Fearless Radio, reaching worldwide audiences listening over the internet. Through a slew of engaging, independent releases (including 2010's Ready, Set... EP and 2012's Over Getting Over), Crowder has once again topped himself with the 2x4 series, with Volume II expected in Spring 2015. Accompanied by lush strings, pristine finger snaps and subtle, heartbeat-like percussion, Crowder is at home on Volume I, keeping things at a mild boil musically, while letting his romantic side genuinely runneth over. Though comparisons to Jeff Buckley, John Mayer or Ben Harper aren't unwarranted, Crowder sports more love for true soul music than any of the above, as evidenced through the rustic tones of acoustic plucks. Though the focus is on Crowder's expert vocals and masterful guitar work, this project is rounded out by hefty contributions from Sidewalk Chalk members Charlie Coffeen and Tyler Berg (co-production/keys and drums, respectively), mixer Chris Harden of IV Lab Studios (who has worked with Plain White T's and Hard Working Americans) and Boiler Room master person Colin Jordan, responsible for assisting a who's who of Chicago hip-hop talent over the years, such as Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Twista. Crowder's connections to his fans and his city are far from done when the final note is sung or the last instrument cable is wrapped up for the night. He's bringing human emotion (and handmade keepsakes in which to collect them) back in an age of a point-and-click music industry.</p>","From solo acoustic, acoustic trio, or full band, Aryk Crowder has a variety of adaptable performance options in which to bring his Chicago made Soul and Rock sound to your event.

In late 2011, recorded an EP &ldquo;As Bad as It Gets&rdquo; at Rax Trax Studios, sighting that they just wanted to get together and record some music at a time when the state of the world felt like things couldn&rsquo;t get any worse. Using &ldquo;As Bad as It Gets&rdquo; as momentum to find like-minded musicians and play shows around the Chicago area, One Season eventually rounded out the lineup with drummer Chris Close and bassist Scott Tooredman. Channeling inspired outbursts of songwriting, comedic episodes, and uncanny jams, One Season has honed a sound that is influenced by a wide variety of sounds. One Season is &ldquo;Omni-Rock&rdquo;, an eclectic concoction consisting of a blues-rock and alternative-rock foundation that&rsquo;s salted with soul, funk, and pop sensibilities. Contributing to this sound is a duo of dynamic lead singers, big harmonies, inspired guitar-work, and undulating vibrations from the rhythm section. A One Season performance is a rousing experience that leaves crowds chanting for one more song at the end of their sets. The band is so dedicated to the music that they will play through smoke, fire alarms, hustling &amp; bustling farmers&rsquo; market crowds, and biker rallies to keep the Omni-Rock alive. One Season has continued to light up cornerstone Chicago venues, including Metro, Double Door, Subterranean, the Cubby Bear, Lincoln Hall, and even the House of Blues and the Hard Rock Cafe, since emerging onto the local music scene with a take-no-prisoners attitude. So, whether it&rsquo;s a one-show tour to New Orleans, a wrestling gig in the suburbs, a naval base performance, a Six Flags all-day event, the open mic around the corner, or a revered music venue, One Season is sure to give fans a genuinely sensational experience. One Season recently released an EP in late 2014 entitled Man on a Mission, which can be found on iTunes, Google Play, Pandora, Spotify, CD Baby, etc.</p>","A diverse blues-based Rock band from Chicago, Illinois.","template.php","default.css","classic rock, blues rock, indie rock, ","inactive","Yearly - Full","2015-03-04 17:39:27","No","One Season","One Season","One Season","Never show in sitemap","Full",

","<p>Humphrey-McKeown is an original Americana (Folk/Rock) band based in the Chicago area. The Humphrey-McKeown (HM) songwriting partnership began in 2006 between New York native, Heather Humphrey and Chicago-based, Tom McKeown. Before long, they were writing for publishers in Nashville, Chicago and LA. Combining Heather’s innate sense of melody with Tom’s pursuit of something new and unexpected. HM wrote for any occasion and in any style; always seeking to better themselves and their craft. When asked “How do you write a better song?” their answer has always been “That’s easy…we write another song.” After penning over 100 songs for others, Tom & Heather turned their focus on writing for their own musical voice. 

Putting together all the pieces to create a great live band, HM brought in “big-beat” drummer/percussionist Jim Livas. Jim then introduced them to bassist extraordinaire Tony Meadors and Tony in turn introduced them to virtuoso violinist/fiddler Jeff Teppema. Incredibly, Tony and Jeff ’s individual auditions actually became the final tracks on the fourth CD “All I Wanted to Hear.” HM’s latest release confirms that their musical puzzle is now complete. 

“From the first note we played together, we all knew this was the sound we had been searching for.” ~ Tom McKeown 

Over four albums HM has been perfecting their mix of experimental folk, upbeat pop with a hint of progressive music and Brill Building songwriting. This combination has created the HM flavored contemporary folk-rock, Americana sound. They begin by weaving together intricate layers of acoustic guitar, mandolin, piano, fiddle and bass and then drop a ten-ton drum kit on top of it. Folk-Rock… with a huge beat and brilliant musicianship. But as great as the music is, HM still puts the primary focus on the voices and the lyrics. 

“It’s not OK for us to just write catchy tunes. It’s more important to create a memory for those who listen – whether it’s soaring or heart-ache, it’s creating that emotional moment.” ~ Heather Humphrey 

Tom and Heather’s combined lead vocals breathe magic into the songs. Their voices are perfectly matched through quiet acoustic ballads, playful pop and edgy ""swampgrass” rock. Humphrey ~ McKeown 

“Great tunes appear to come naturally them and their songs invariably come loaded with plentiful hooks and the kind of choruses that stick around.” ~ Leicester Bangs, UK 

“Tried and tested, yet fresh sounding male-female medley reaching across the expanse of lush tracks. Diverse instruments – each featuring and acoustic twang- the formula works! Tender and heart-warming… great lyrics and guitar-work.” ~Spy District

Composed of seasoned pros and DIE-HARD FANS of Nirvana, Smells Like Nirvana’s live tribute to Nirvana is a haunting episode of grunge filled angst and rock prowess. Smells Like Nirvana is one of Chicago's newest up and coming tribute acts! They are captivating the hearts of Nirvana fans night after night, show after show. You definitely want to watch Smells Like Nirvana live as they recreate the legendary sounds of Nirvana. Few bands in rock history have had a more immediate and connectable impact on their contemporary rock musical landscape than Nirvana did in the early nineties and 20 years later Smells Like Nirvana is capturing and re-creating the heart felt angst and passion of Nirvana night after night, performance after performance. Why did SMELLS LIKE NIRVANA get started? Smells Like Nirvana is an attempt at honoring Nirvana’s Legacy by staying true to the mechanics of what Nirvana was all about which was being a real organic rock band. No click tracks or backing tracks, what you hear is what you get and that’s loud angst guitars and drums coupled with a passionate trio on stage remembering the late great Kurt Cobain. It’s been 20 years since the original line up of Nirvana has taken the stage and it’s sad to think of the loss of the legend Kurt Cobain who unfortunately took his own life at 27, joining club 27 with such artists at Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. In no shape or form is the Chicago Nirvana Tribute ’Smells like Nirvana’ trying to replace Nirvana; THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE. No one can replace Nirvana. Smells Like Nirvana is a celebration of Nirvana, three die hard fans of Nirvana sharing their love of Nirvana.</p>","Smells Like Nirvana is Chicago’s grungiest tribute to Nirvana playing songs from the albums Bleach, Incesticide, Nevermind, In Utero and MTV Unplugged.

Negotiable. ","<p>My name is Daniel Weisberg. I am a Hip-Hop artist and rapper.  I have written and helped produce two mix-tapes.  I have performed at a variety of venues as well as been on an IHeart radio talk show.  I perform weekly at open mics along with any other opportunities that present themselves.  

I am 20 years old, from Chicago, Illinois, and a college student.  Ever since I was a child, I have been in love with music.  I grew up listening to The Spinners, Frank Sinatra and the Gypsy Kings due to my grandparents influence. During my early childhood, I was mainly inspired by Michael Jackson and would sing and dance his music all day and night.  I performed on stage at a restaurant and a couple of parties and every other opportunity I received.  I got a lot of love after each event!  It wasn’t until my junior year of high school that I realized I wanted to make a career out of music!

I lived in Puerto Rico for three years where I was exposed to different kinds of music. This led me to broaden my musical taste even further. After returning to the States, I realized music was my passion. One night, my friend told me that due to the competition, focusing on being a rapper would be a waste of time and that I could do something more time useful, like journalism, due to my love of sports.  Ever since then, I told myself I would prove him and anyone else wrong. I would be that one of 100,000 that make it as a rapper, and 1 of 1,000,000 that make it as a successful musician!  

I have always loved music, and I began to become more diverse while learning more history.  I started listening to soul and funk from the 50s, R&B from the 60s, and many old school rap artists.  I originally heard a lot of these songs with my grandparents so they were a bit familiar to me.  As I got older, Michael Jackson was and always will be my inspiration, but I have other inspirations also.  Some of these include: Tupac Shakur, Eminem, Jackson 5, and the Spinners.  

My goal is to be one of the most successful and diverse entertainers of all time.  I want to be the greatest rapper and branch out to have a fantastic future in singing, dancing and acting.  I feel I am unique in Hip Hop because I do not curse in any of the music that I make and all of my music is relevant to my current lifestyle, thought process, and the world around me.  I take what I learn from older professionals, and I make my own style, trying to incorporate a variety of beats and musical styles. 

In my recent mixtape that dropped on Valentine’s Day called “Grind Harder,” I talk about very deep subject matter, from the death of my grandmother to the violence of black on black crime.  I am always writing and have released a single since then.

I no longer have dreams, I only have goals, and my goal is on a great path with my current sophomore year attendance at Columbia College Chicago. 

I look forward to working with you!</p>",,"template.php","default.css","Hip-Hop, Rap, Pop","active","Yearly - Full","2015-06-16 12:20:11","No","Independent","Independent","Independent","Never show in sitemap","Full",

A powerful live act, Avon Dale combines well-crafted indie rock tunes with lengthy improvisational jams. With a raw, energetic presence, Avon Dale has quickly become a must-see act.

Rock with a slight Tilt?! Would someone please Fire The Canon! Yes! We spelled ""Canon"" instead of ""Cannon"" to reflect the musical term, ""Canon"". Just trying to be creative. Fire The Canon! Up and coming teen band... Performing family friendly classic rock, modern rock and originals including their original song ""DONUT GIRL"". ""DONUT GIRL"" was written upon lead guitarist Andrew buying donuts and a cute girl wrote her number on the back of his receipt. He later texted the number and got no reply. She eventually attended a show but informed the hopeful young rocker that she got a boyfriend and was no longer available. Leading to the plea ""DoNut break my heart"". Hopes of dating ""Donut Girl"" will live on in song. ""DONUT GIRL"" will be available later this summer on Fire The Canons debut cd... soon to be available on itunes, spotify, Amazon and more. Lead Guitar &amp; Vocals Andrew Gallagher was born in Chicago. His mom a professional singer and his dad a drummer. Andrews first real experience in music was when his father took him to a Peter Gabriel Concert when he was four years old. Andrew grew up listening to Peter Gabriel, Genesis, The Foo Fighters, Led Zeppelin, and Coldplay, which were mostly a direct influence of his father. Andrew started out playing the drums when he was four, but never got very attached to them. When Andrew was 6 he got his first guitar from his grandparents along with a DVD Tutorial. He struggled with it at such a young age. He later picked it up again in 6th grade after taking a music class. He grabbed his old guitar and used YouTube to learn. His Great Uncle then gave him an old acoustic guitar that Andrew played until he bought his first electric guitar. The summer after his freshman year of High School, Drew put together a band with him as the lead guitarist and singer, a friend as the bass player, and his brother Ryan Gallagher on drums, but his friend quit the band due to creative differences. He then turned to another friend, Ryan King and asked if he would join. After one jam session they were set and performed at a small party with some friends. Later Tristan Abrams joined as the lead vocalist and Drew became the lead guitar player. This is the band we know today. Drew continues to rock his heart out and pursue his passion for music. Bass Guitar Ryan King began listening to music from a very early age, especially rock, since his Dad is an avid listener and piano and guitar player. Ryan developed an ear for the guitar and started tinkering around with an acoustic when he was 9 years old. His interest to learn brought an excellent guitar teacher, Marco, in to his life. With weekly lessons and lots of jam sessions with his dad, Ryan gained a love for all kinds of music and the desire to play both acoustic and electric guitars. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Ryan to discover his true passion, the bass guitar. Which he played in High school Jazz band. With his quiet demeanor, Ryan felt the rhythm of music and began to hone his skills on the bass by the age of 13. His major influences have, so far, been primarily his father and the bass guitarist from his favorite band, Rush. Ryan would say that his greatest decision so far in life has been joining forces with Andrew and Ryan Gallagher and Tristan Abrams to form the band Fire The Canon. Ryan loves doing his signature jumping and behind the head playing moves for the fans. Drums Ryan Gallagher he brings the BOOM! to Fire The Canon! Ryan started banging on the drums at the age of 2 with some help from his Dad... He is influenced by Genesis and Phil Collins as well as Neil Peart and John Bonham. Sometimes we think he has John Bonham trapped in his body! He may look little but he does Big things! Vocals &amp; Guitar Tristan Jewel Abrams is a true Rock star. Born to musician parents, given a stage name &ldquo;Tristan Jewel&rdquo; from birth, some could say she was born of music. She has been around music her entire existence and took some of her first steps backstage among Rock Legends such as The GrassRoots, Ides of March and Peter Noone. Theaters and Stages are more like Home to her, where Sound Engineers and Stage Crew become her family. As a toddler she would mimic her Dads (Bob Abrams, formerly of The Buckinghams) stage moves with a little red guitar and put on shows for her siblings and in her front yard. Tristan started playing piano at age 3, singing and playing guitar at age 7, bass guitar at age 10, and Saxophone at age 12. She has been a composer and ASCAP writer since age 7. Her elementary teacher Mr. Ortman played Charlie Parker in class where Tristan fell in love with Jazz, it encouraged her to follow in her Grandfather, Bob Abrams Sr., Mother and Fathers footsteps of Jazz training. Tristan Jewel attended The Music Institute of Chicago where she was one of the youngest students in the Adult Jazz Studies Program. Tristan has also had the privilege of recording in studios such as Engine Studios and playing venues such as The Metro in Chicago with Girls Rock at the age of 11 and again at age 12. Tristan bought her first Vinyl Album from Jonas Grigola at the Chicagoland Record Show when she was about 12 years old, it was Jefferson Airplane, ""Flight Log"" and now she is singing her own version of ""Somebody To Love"" with Fire The Canon! More recently Tristan as a vocalist has opened at the Arcada Theatre for Acts such as Jefferson Starship. She has also performed Jazz shows with greats such as Wayne Messmer. She is excited about and loves her band brothers in Fire The Canon! Nothing but great things in the future.</p>","Band Members are ages 12-16! Not Your Average Teen Band!

Philadelphia Phil spent his childhood in Paris, France, Biloxi, Mississippi, Atlanta, Georgia and Swanton, Vermont, before landing in the steel mill town of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, where he grew up in the smokestack shadows of blue collar America. Escaping high school he made Philadelphia his home, alternating between the turf that gave the world John Coltrane, Philly Joe Jones and Stanley Clark, and cities across America, living for a time in Buffalo, New Orleans, Fort Worth, even Iowa, before settling in the Heartland.

Zach's performance is perfect for corporate events, private events, festivals, school assemblies, and so many other venues. Zach also does walk around sleight of hand magic that is perfect for private parties, weddings, and corporate get togethers.

","<p>Olivia Dvorak performs many of her original songs, and of course, a variety of fan favorites such as Miranda Lambert, KT Tunstall, Fleetwood Mac, and even Jackson 5. Olivia's show is an experience that keeps her audience entertained from a high energy hour set, or through the journey of a 3 hour show. Using her custom looper pedal set up and intricate guitar skills, she is truly the essence of a one man band.</p>","<p>Artist | Singer | Songwriter | Guitarist | Performer Olivia Dvorak is a songwriter and artist whose unique songs, lyrics, and intricate guitar playing led her to professionally record in Nashville, TN at Treasure Isle Recorders with some of the top musicians in the city. Her unique country style pours into genres such as rock, blues, Celtic, and folk. Since she recorded, Olivia has won two RAMI Awards for Artist of the Year and Song of the Year, played at one of Nashville&rsquo;s iconic venues, the Bluebird Cafe, has been a guest speaker for several inspirational youth events, and has directly supported country music&rsquo;s legendary Loretta Lynn, Scotty McCreery, Jana Kramar, Drake Bell, Trace Adkins, and the Band Perry. Surrounded by a family of musicians, Olivia began her journey by singing when she was able to talk and begging to take piano lessons before her hands were big enough to reach the keys. After taking six years of piano lessons from her mom, Olivia's dad helped her discover the instrument that she would soon fall in love with for the remainder of her career: the guitar. At ten years old, she was strumming chords, picking melodies, leading worship at church, and performing Celtic music in her family's band. Songwriting was never in the forefront of her mind, but the emotions of junior high brought out a gift in Olivia that would soon propel her to places that she never thought she would go. What started off as simple songs about life, relationships, and experiences, soon matured into tunes that began to touch people from the ages of five years old to fifty. As the young artist walked across the stage to receive her High School diploma, her path led her straight to Bradley University to pursue a major in Graphic Design. After a year of art classes, writing songs in her spare time, playing too loud in her dorm room, and then winning Bradley's ""Idol Competition,"" Olivia realized that her heart was leading her towards a life of music entertainment. At the end of her freshman year, the nineteen year old&rsquo;s experience at a Keith Urban concert was enough to launch her straight to a songwriter's festival in Nashville. Olivia explained, ""I was amazed that one person could touch a whole stadium of people with a three minute song... I knew in that moment that I needed to do the same thing."" That summer, only a week in Nashville allowed Olivia to meet the former manager of the Beach Boys and current owner of Treasure Isle Recorders, Fred Vail. Alongside of her parents, Fred began to push the soon the be country star through an intense summer of writing, and a week of recording in the studio. The extreme focus, dedication, and sacrifice that the aspiring musician practiced when she laid down the tracks for her album ""Don't Come Knockin,'"" has not wavered. Once the summer ended and the recording sessions were under raps, Olivia decided to hone in on her craft by earning a commercial music degree at Greenville College in Southern Illinois. During a semester of barely passing music theory, working hard at ear training, and exploring the world of Classical voice, she decided to take a leap of faith with the undying support of her parents. At twenty years old, Olivia completely dropped out of college in the winter of 2013 because she felt so strongly about immersing herself in the music business outside of school. Building a career from the ground up would prove to be a long, rigorous journey for the entrepreneur as she went to every open mic she could, played for free at coffee shops, and quickly moved up to bar gigs, private parties, and weddings. ""If I don't learn every single aspect of how to make a living by performing, managing myself, booking my own shows, and doing the dirty work, how will I know how to be a professional in this crazy industry?"" the songwriter stated. As she perfected her skills, professionalism, and songwriting over the course of a couple years, Olivia met her current sound engineer, Jeremy Rollefson, who helped the process of developing her unique live sound along with her dad. With the encouragement and love from her family, friends, and ever-supporting fans, the talented singer/songwriter received an opportunity in the spring of 2015 that would change the course of her entire career. Boldly strumming her guitar, and singing with more passion than anyone had heard in years from a twenty-two year old girl, Olivia took the stage to directly open for Country's original female star, Loretta Lynn. The whole audience at the Arcada Theater immediately connected with the young performer's personality, performance and songs. ""The most important thing I can do as a songwriter is to place my hand into the deepest crevices of my heart. This allows me to discover specific truths about myself in order to have a general understanding of the human heart as a whole. Each song I write needs to be honest, relatable, and strong."" A true artist, songwriter, and lover of other people, Olivia makes her goal in life to write songs that simply take people with her on her journey.</p>","Artist | Singer | Songwriter | Guitarist ","template.php","default.css","Country, Rock, Folk, Celtic, Blues","active","Monthly - Full","2015-11-16 12:29:54","No","Olivia Dvorak","Olivia Dvorak","Olivia Dvorak","Never show in sitemap","Full",

Although she is a lover of various music genres, she is most deeply influenced by jazz, musical theatre and pop. Foline, a theatre geek in school, was cast in such musicals as &ldquo;Cabaret,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oklahoma&rdquo; and &ldquo;Once on This Island.&rdquo; At the age of 11, her first demo received airplay on Chicago's Hip Hop radio station, WGCI. A native of Chicago, Foline spent her late teens conscientiously recording demos with various producers, including Earl Powell, who is best known for his collaboration with singer Jennifer Hudson. It was at this time that Foline first began to develop her talent and passion for songwriting, incorporating pop elements with her soulful sound . Later she met Sue Carey and the late Karena Mendoza, both of whom cast her in the principal role in their musical collaboration, &ldquo;Africa &amp; Plumbridge,&rdquo; which won the New York International Fringe Festival award for best songwriting. Sue and Karena, each a classically trained opera singer, grew to be Foline's mentors and helped her further develop a more theatrical sound and presence for the stage. Foline was recently seen performing &ldquo;Urinetown&rdquo; the musical at Munroe Park Theatre Guild in Chicago last spring. In addition, she has a newly-recorded demo-which includes two songs she wrote under the direction of saxophonist and arranger Roy McGrath.</p>","Foline Roos is a singer-songwriter whose soulful, theatrical style has been deeply enriched by her musical collaborations throughout the years.

Their recent single &ldquo;I Need Love&rdquo; was named one of the top 100 Songs of the Year by the Boston Herald and Nelson was coined &ldquo;The Voice of Vermont&rdquo; in a cover story printed about her in the Burlington Free Press. She then went on to receive major accolades with her haunting version of Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; which became a nationwide hit at #24 on the iTunes pop charts. In the summer of 2015, before a pin-drop silent crowd of over 5,000 at Bernie Sanders presidential campaign kick off, Nicole sang a gorgeous rendition of &ldquo;God Bless America.&rdquo; It was an unforgettable performance that left the crowd completely stunned. 2015 ended on a very high note with a string of sold out concerts up and down the East Coast; nominations for &ldquo;Best Vocalist in Vermont,&rdquo; &ldquo;Best in State &ndash; Vermont,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Band of the Year&rdquo; by the New England Music Awards. In January 2016 DWIGHT &amp; NICOLE spent a magical afternoon at Burlington&rsquo;s Signal Kitchen with friends &amp; fellow VT act Kat Wright and the Indomitable Soul Band to record a historic version of Woody Guthries &ldquo;This Land is Your Land&rdquo;. Their heartfelt rendition has garnered hundreds of thousands of views online over just the first few days, quickly becoming an exciting break out song for the artists involved, and for the Bernie campaign. While the duo is already well known in the Northeast, 2016 finds them poised to break nationally with a new album in the works to be recorded in a secluded studio setting, just outside of Burlington. They will be playing live directly to tape, capturing the unique intimacy, serious chops, and raw power that their fans have come to know and love. DWIGHT &amp; NICOLE are a tight knit band on the brink of major success. Don&rsquo;t miss a chance to see them live. See what all the talk is about, and go home uplifted and inspired. &ldquo;Take R&amp;B, soul, blues and jazz, mix in razor-sharp rock guitar (Dwight), a soulful, joyful, foot-stomping, happy-to-be-alive stage energy (Nicole), heat to boiling, and watch your face melt.

Each song sets off on a journey of its own. Thick layers of guitars sound more like distress signals and woeful mourning; the keys and trombone add layers of texture and depth, while drums and bass set a pulse that delivers each composition to its natural conclusion. The always-evolving chord progressions, and picturesque and introspective lyrics evoke a mood, a feeling and, undeniably, a train of thought&hellip;. Throughout its growth and evolution, the band has been expanding its fan base, having performed in New York, Denver, Cleveland, Columbus, Milwaukee and other cities in the Midwest and on the East Coast. Their music has appeared on public radio like WBEZ and Vocalo, college radio stations like WLUW, and Spanish stations like NOX Live. The band continues to maintain a devoted following in its hometown appearing regularly at such hot-spots as Chicago&rsquo;s Metro, House of Blues, Lincoln Hall, Martyrs&rsquo;, Subterranean, Double Door, and many others. Kelroy released their third full-length album in February 2015.</p>","Kelroy creates a sound that combines intricacy of composition with simplicity of delivery, drifting between hints of post rock, blues & alternative, as they pour time & essence into the vortex of sound they shape","template.php","default.css","Indie Rock/Alternative Rock","active","Monthly - Full","2016-03-02 13:34:58","No","Kelroy","Kelroy","Kelroy","Never show in sitemap","Full",

International Delmark recording artist Linsey Alexander is available for bookings now! Born in Mississippi and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Linsey Alexander discovered a down to earth city that truly understands and appreciates music on Chicago's southside. In much the same way as many great blues artists before him, he grew up in a poor but honest and hard working family, learning early on that music has the power to lift the spirit and comfort the soul. In Linsey's own words, ""Blues is not hard- it's just a documentary about life."" His first guitar - a gift from a family friend who played on the front stoop of Linsey's home in Memphis - was never retrieved from the pawn shop where he left it almost 50 years ago. Using the money to help pay his way to Chicago, he now plays a variety of Gibson and Fender guitars. Since 1959, Linsey Alexander has been perfecting the art of entertainment blues for the sheer and simple pleasure of it. His easy smile and unpretentious personality define a charismatic entertainer who loves to perform; and perform he does! Although having played with B.B.King, Bobby Rush, Buddy Guy, Little Milton, Magic Slim, Johnnie Taylor, A.C.Reed, Larry McCray, Bither Smith, John Primer, Otis Clay, Eddie Clearwater, and other great blues performers, Linsey Alexander has remained resolutely true to his own style. His earlier CD's released, ""Someone&rsquo;s Cookin' in My Kitchen,"" ""My Days Are So Long,"" and ""If You Ain't Got It"" are all three compilations of original Blues and R&amp;B tunes. Alexander has been to 10 countries and all across America spreading the joy of blues. He is thankful for the good things in his life, and now at last, seems willing to realize that the friends that encouraged him to keep playing over the years may have known a thing or two about talent. Linsey has ""never truly believed in himself"" until now; Now, he is ready to believe. In 2012, He signed with Delmark Records and recorded his first international CD, ""Been There, Done That."" Linsey's recent CD, released in August 2014, ""Come Back Baby,"" landed Linsey a spot as number three best Chicago Blues album. Linsey Alexander was inducted into the Chicago Blues Hall of Fame June 8th, 2014. Linsey Alexander's tour put him in Mexico, Brazil and France. Alexander plans to return to Brazil and France soon in 2016.</p>","Why not have an authentic Chicago Blues Band entertain at your even?t!

Made up of 10 to 17 year old siblings, The Mags produce a classic sound with a shameless, new-fashioned twist. These four sinling rockers bailed on classical instruments a few years ago to pick up drums and electric guitars and they never looked back. Elliott, the oldest, plays lead guitar and writes the music. Eden sings lead, plays guitar, and writes the band's imaginative lyrics. The Kim Deal of the group is 12 year old bassist and back up singer Eliza. Drummer, Everett, plays louder and faster than you would believe an 10 year old could. He's also known to enjoy MadLibs and sing Fugazi in his sleep. You know, typical 10 year old stuff. Inspired by Operation Ivy, The Aquabats!, Rancid and various YouTube musicians, The Magnifiers set out to write their own music: catchy songs with creative words. Their tunes tend to give a comical and somewhat snarky look at the world and they'll make you highly aware of the probable impending zombie apocalypse. Hopefully you can check them out before then.

Get Toned 2. Work 3. Van Gough</p>","<p><span>Music genres evolve and fluctuate with the decades. And as a genre of music that spawned out of a necessity to spread the st</span><span>ory of a people, Hip-Hop has grown and changed as well. It&rsquo;s evolved and broken into many sub genres over the years. Unfortunately, the sub genre most popularly known by the masses is one that many true Hip-Hop heads passionately dislike. This new popular form of the music is quite often categorized as simply &ldquo;Commercial Rap&rdquo;. And just when you think there&rsquo;s no recovery, a new sub genre and a new voice is born.</span></p>
<p><span><br />YBC Tha Nerd, born Edward White, is an up and coming rapper from the city of Chicago. A member of the group Nerdtastic, formed with friend and partner Black Rambo, YBC Tha Nerd has been rapping for eleven years now. Nerdtastic has been a concept in progress for quite some time, but didn&rsquo;t actually come to fruition until about a year ago. After hours spent writing and in the studio, with the occasional break for Gaming and Anime, Nerdtastic will certainly be a rap-duo to watch out for.<br /><br />YBC Tha Nerd was frustrated with the current state of Commercial Rap and wanting to give a voice to those like him, Nerdtastic has created their own sub genre of music which has been dubbed, &ldquo;Nerd-Hop&rdquo;. Music for the intelligent, elite and lovers of Hip-Hop is what he promises to deliver. Drawing on inspiration from sources like 2Pac, Common and Mos Def musically and historical philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato and Martin Luther King Jr, this is a genre that promises to astound and enlighten the currently jaded masses. And after years of songs that only create one bad dance after another, Nerdtastic promises to become a great addition to the Hip-Hop legacy. And perhaps offer the salvation, that many might argue, the genre desperately needs.</span></p>","Hip Hop/ EDM/ Dubstep/ Rock","template.php","default.css","Hip-Hop, Rock","active","Monthly - Full","2016-04-13 06:06:12","No","Edward White","Edward White","Edward White","Never show in sitemap","Full",

“Sam Hankins is a brilliant trumpeter who stretches himself within the genre of smooth jazz. His tone sometimes hints at Chuck Mangione while his solos are generally more explorative than that of Chris Botti and Rick Braun, even when he caresses melodies. On his latest CD, Nothing Between Us, Hankins plays all of the instruments in most cases, including several brass instruments, keyboards and percussion, taking an effective vocal on the love song “I Can Be.” Throughout the project, Hankins displays the influences of R&B and funky jazz. He has a knack for coming up with memorable and catchy riffs and, like the late Grover Washington Jr, he is capable of playing lengthy solos over fairly simple backgrounds that never lose one’s interest. His ten originals each have their moments. “Nothing Between Us” features some powerful trumpet playing. “See Me” finds Hankins playing muted a la Miles Davis while the ensembles build in density and intensity. One can imagine the rhythmic piece “Reach For Me” being sung someday. “Give It A Try” and “You Should Have” in particularly features Sam Hankins at his best, showing a lot of personality, color and wit in his solos while carving out his own place in contemporary jazz. — Scott Yanow, author of The Jazz Singers, The Great Jazz Guitarists, Jazz On Film and Jazz On Record 1917-76

I'm available to play music at all kinds of events such as: concert halls, corporate functions, private parties, weddings, celebrations, religious services, restaurants, ect. I spent a year in Los Angeles studying at Musician's Institute in Hollywood. While in L.A, I studied with Grammy Award winning classical guitarist/composer, Evan Hirschelman. Evan helped me to become a more technically sound, well-rounded, and expressive musician. An injury to the median nerve in my right hand cut my studies short, forcing me to move back to Chicago, where my hand was surgically repaired. Once my hand healed, I continued my studies at Prairie State College and joined the PSC jazz band. I won a most outstanding player award at the Lake County Community College Jazz Contest. I graduated from Prairie State with a Liberal Arts degree and decided to dedicate myself primarily to classical guitar. Upon earning my Associates Degree from PSC, I developed a repertoire of over 30 solo guitar tunes, half of them classical compositions, the other half includes jazz tunes, popular songs, and a few of my own compositions. I've been invited to share my music at multiple weddings and restaurants (Cilantro, Svagatti's, Grape&amp; Grain) in Chicago and its suburbs. Currently, I'm teaching guitar at Down Home Guitars in Frankfort Illinois, and the Beverly Arts Center. In 2013, I decided to continue my classical guitar studies at Columbia College Chicago. I'm a performance scholarship award winner at Columbia College and as of December 2015, I'm a Bachelor of Music graduate.</p>
<p>Scott did an amazing job with our wedding ceremony. He learned a number of new songs and traveled to play them for us a month before our event. He even offered to attend the rehearsal! Each phone conversation or meeting was handled in a very professional manner. Scott's performance during the ceremony was outstanding. Guests commented that they enjoyed his guitar and were moved by his performance. He nailed the songs we had asked him to learn, and brought his own microphone and speaker setup; saving us some serious $ from the DJ. Definitely hire Scott for your event! Review by Becky S. FROM CHICAGO, IL ON 7/28/2012 ""Scott provided the perfect backdrop to our wedding. We wanted to add a calm, yet warm and beautiful sound to our ceremony and Scott really came through. His classical acoustic stylings really set the mood. He was easy to work with and knowledgeable, learning 4 specific songs for our wedding. I would recommend him to all friends and family."" - Nick S., Frankfort, IL Fantastic Scott was easy to work with and is amazingly talented. I cannot recommend him highly enough.

Growing up in the chicago suburbs, my initial exposure to night life began in my late teens, introducing me to the influential role of the party DJ. I admired the DJ's i experienced and they connected me with the crowd made me want to pursue DJ-ing even more. I learned the basics from a friend and from there began my career. Stepping out into the city club and bar scene in my early 20's, I had met and learned from DJ's around me including Sye Young, DJ Metro, and Rick Garcia. Finding my niche, I learned what I loved to do, ""Please the crowd. I am an open format DJ, so I literally can play everything; everything."" With musical versatility that is scarcely unmatched, I myself is set apart, but I find most satisfaction in my interaction with the crowd. ""To be able to feel everyone's vibe in the room,"" is what I value most and because of that along with having a great time with what I do, DJ Profess aka me is able to create prolific party experiences for any event at any venue.</p>","DJ Profess is able to create prolific party experiences for any event at any venue.","template.php","default.css","Dj","inactive","Monthly - Full","2016-06-17 14:35:02","No","DJ profess","DJ profess","DJ profess","Never show in sitemap","Full",

In 2013 and 2014 Charlie was contacted by the producers of &nbsp;&ldquo;The Voice&rdquo; and invited to audition in both Chicago and Dallas. &nbsp;His arresting single &ldquo;Take Control&rdquo; recently reached #7 on Internet Radio Station Q108 Kingston. &nbsp;</p>","Independent Pop Singer/Songwriter, Recording Artist and Vocalist.","template.php","default.css","Pop, Singer/Songwriter, Top 40, Classic Rock","inactive","Monthly - Full","2016-09-19 21:15:07","No","Charlie Millikin","Charlie Millikin","Charlie Millikin","Never show in sitemap","Full",

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; The time is now and that initial vision has arrived. After years of diligence, including a nation-wide talent search, Kist has attained it&rsquo;s initial goal and continues to strive for a show that keeps the fans asking for more.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basing it&rsquo;s stage show on the unrivaled Kiss shows of the 1970&rsquo;s, Kist derives it&rsquo;s set-list mostly from the make-up era catalogue, but does add in a few ""out of make-up catalouge suprises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visually, the band prides itself on members that physically &ldquo;fit&rdquo; the part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sonically, countless hours of study and rehearsal has helped hone the band&rsquo;s razor sharp edge. A Kist show brings all the fire and magic one would expect at a Kiss show.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Booking KIST along with proper promo ensures a ""slam dunk"" for your venue or event because their goal is to deliver the goods with every performance from load-in thru set-up, performance and after show meet 'n' greets.</div>","KISS tribute band","template.php","default.css","Tribute band","inactive","Monthly - Full","2017-03-27 09:31:01","No","KIST, Kiss Tribute Band","KIST, Kiss Tribute Band","KIST, Kiss Tribute Band","Never show in sitemap","Full",

Drawing from that shared life experience they found a recipe to blend it into a musical style like no other band. Two words: Power Trio. Their original compositions employ a wide range of rhythmic grooves and styles, soulful vocals, and memorable guitar lines and on occasion the added texture of a Hammond organ. Listening to a Few Miles On album takes you right back to the early 70&rsquo;s; a golden era of creative freedom when many of their musical influences dominated the radio airwaves. On stage they understand how to connect with their audience and bring them along as the band moves through a set filled with rocking shuffles, emotional ballads, funky grooves and hypnotic delta blues numbers. At their live performances fans often say it is hard to believe that a three-piece band could create such a big sound.

","<p>Where the Bottles Dance Tides Oh, Money Want You Bad Going Down Young Again (Cover song) County Jail Nostalgist Make it Home</p>","<p>Bringing the Summer Sun year-round in Chicago. *JBTV performance aired March 8, 2017 w/ The Orwells, NE-HI &amp; Circa Waves *1st full length album, ""Tides"", released August 2016 *Several sold old performances in 2016: Lincoln Hall, Subterranean, Double Door, Beat Kitchen, etc. *Performed at the Remix Festival *South Africa Fall tour in 2017 It all started in Chicago and somehow ended up in sunny Berlin. Chicago-based Ballroom Boxer was looking to work with someone on their first single and subsequent album. After a few warm leads with a couple of L.A. producers, they finally found a fit in Gordon Raphael, their hero for his work on the first couple of Strokes&rsquo; albums, as well as Electrical Audio, recently featured on Dave Grohl&rsquo;s/Foo Fighters HBO special &lsquo;Sonic Highways&rsquo;. &ldquo;We wanted to forge our own path on our first album so we rethought everything,&rdquo; singer/guitarist, Mike Altier said. &ldquo;We skipped (working with) a label and instead, used the money from commercial licensing to write the album at a Wisconsin lakehouse, work on the first single with Gordon via Berlin and track the rest of the album at Electrical Audio with Jon San Paulo and Flashpoint Tribeca with Tim Rusin.&rdquo; So far the way they&rsquo;ve re-imagined the recording process is paying off. The band has already generated interest from labels, radio stations and festivals, including playing in South Africa in 2017. The band created a Snapchat lyric video for their first single, &lsquo;Make It Home&rsquo; engineered by Gordon Raphael. The new album, 'Tides', is available everywhere digitally and on vinyl at https://ballroomboxer.bandcamp.com/album/tides-2. Give it a wiggle!</p>","Summer rock n roll band from Chicago.

<p>&ldquo;We grew up going to see the bands we cover, and those shows were loud and heavy and the crowd is moving and singing along,&rdquo; says vocalist Brian Rowe. &ldquo;You're part of a community, so you drop your inhibitions and become a part of the night, both in the audience and on the stage. I don't get the same feeling from cover bands. So with our band, we wanted to bring the experience of seeing all your favorite bands in the same night, and give the audience the same feeling of community and enthusiasm, to have a unique experience among cover bands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based out of Chicago, Addy's Corner plays your favorite songs from your high school years. Focusing on alternative and pop punk from the 90's and 2000's, their shows promote maximum crowd participation and monumental sing-alongs for the entire night. There are no outfits, no gimmicks- just raw energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.025em;"">The band derives their setlist from days spent listening to Chicago&rsquo;s Q101, hearing artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers and Foo Fighters played in heavy rotation, but also lesser known hits of the early 2000&rsquo;s by Fall Out Boy, Yellowcard, and Panic! At The Disco. The band also puts their own spin on some well known hits, such as their fist-pumping cover of Smash Mouth&rsquo;s All Star.</span></p>
<p>Founded in 2015, the band has played all over Chicago, including headlining slots at House of Blues, The Original Mothers, and rounding out 2016 at Cubby Bear.

We are comfortable in a variety of settings, such as in clubs, festivals, community events and parties, and church services or church-related special events. The Annie Young Gospel Blues Band is a new musical group based in Elgin, IL. The band is Annie Young on vocals, Greg Schiller on bass, Bill Crampton on harmonica, Bruce Scoville on drums, and Joe Misek on electric guitar. Since she was a young girl, Annie Young wanted to be a singer. Throughout her life, she sang in choirs at church, and wrote lyrics to potential songs, saving them for over twenty years in some cases. Without any musical education, Annie waited patiently for musicians to come into her life and bring her songs to life. At the Vineyard Church of Elgin, Annie collaborated with several musicians to compose and record her first song, I Saw A Miracle. The church issued a CD of original music from members of the church, and I Saw A Miracle landed on it and quickly became a favorite of the church. Several years later, Annie met Bill Crampton, a multi-instrumentalist who loved the idea of lending his harmonica playing to Annie's blues and gospel music. Then Annie met Joe Misek, an electric guitar player and blues enthusiast. The three met to jam, and new songs started to emerge. The first two songs the trio wrote, Come See About Me and Jesus Can Heal the Pain became staples in their repertoire whenever they shared their music with people. More songs emerged, and eventually the group decided to record a full, ten song CD in the summer of 2014. The resulting CD is Jesus Can Heal the Pain, Annie's debut CD. After six months of occasionally playing as a trio for small crowds, the group decided to assemble a full electric band. Greg Schiller, who played bass on the CD, rejoined the fray in the fall of 2015, and Bruce Scoville joined as their drummer in the summer of 2016. Together, the Annie Young Gospel Blues Band blends styles that historically fuse the expression of pain and the expression of joy. Both blues and gospel music heal and celebrate. Behind each original song in the band's catalog is a story from Annie's life. If you can somehow manage to suppress your dancing and clapping enough to listen deeply to the story, you see that the songs do not airbrush out the rough parts of the narrative. Rather, the songs celebrate the victory over life's troubles, the faith in God that brought Annie through, and the hope we have that we can endure the next trial that comes. In a recent talent competition, Annie and each instrumentalist backing her up were each described as a ""powerhouse"". Whether you hear their music live or recorded in the studio, you will be inspired and full of joy by the Annie Young Gospel Blues Band.</p>","Our band delivers musical performance of primarily original songs that blend gospel, blues, rock, and soul music.

Fall Back to You - Perpetual Process from Niche Visuals - Ralph Klisiewicz on Vimeo.",,"<p>Perpetual Process started as a simple musical experimentation. Over a decade, however, this experimentation grew into an eclectic blend of lush female vocals, exotic electronic sounds, and mix of live instruments. The project was founded by Ralph Klisiewicz, who writes and produces most of the content. The initial idea was to produce mostly electronic music. At the time inception of Perpetual Process, the computer plug-in revolution was taking place. This made the production of music possible without the need of a commercial studio. The decision was made to avoid electronic DJ like sets and instead perform Perpetual Process music in a setting of live instruments. Therefore, Ralph set out to form a band. First member to join Perpetual Process was Cornelius Boon. Cornelius is a bass player with many years of live experience. Cornelius moved to Chicago in 1995 and joined industrial band 13MG. The band toured nationally for 4 years. He also played a series of shows with the Final Cut, including opening dates with Pigface. Given his experience, he has been essential in the transition of Perpetual Process from an electronic home studio project to a live band. Perpetual Process rotated several singers and drummers while performing at local Chicago venues for few years. Eventually the band settled on Kevin (Jrumz) Jones who is a studio drummer working in Chicago. He developed his skills initially playing for various gospel bands. However, over the last several years he has been hired to record for artists ranging in various styles such as rock, R&amp;B and Funk. One could say that his style is a fusion of Stewart Copeland and Carter Beauford. The addition of such a talented drummer immediately added an organic element to the Perpetual Process sound while maintaining its roots to electronics. Katie Somers was the last musical piece added to Perpetual Process. Katie has been studying music for years. She also helped run a children's music school in Chicago&rsquo;s north suburbs. Katie has a smooth jazzy-lounge style yet her voice posses a powerful emotional drive. Her voice is now an instantly recognizable component of what makes the unique sound of Perpetual Process.</p>","Perpetual Process started as a simple musical experimentation.

For Virginian&nbsp;<span>Crystal Day</span>, the spotlight is where she calls home. Her powerhouse vocals and prodigious writing ability lends her a musical style comparable to that of Shania Twain and Katy Perry. There is no denying that she is comfortable with sharing her gift to a crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the daughter of a racetrack owner, Crystal was accustomed to being in front of large audiences beginning at a very young age. On her eighth birthday, she was serenated by a crowd of 100,000 at Charlotte Motor Speedway and a few short years later, she was there performing the National Anthem for the same crowd. The young songstress released a debut album,&nbsp;</span><span>Anything Can Happen</span><span>, at the age of thirteen. This lead to opportunities to sing the National Anthem at NASCAR&rsquo;s Martinsville (Virginia), South Boston Motor Speedway (Virginia) and at Orange County Speedway (North Carolina).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Her passion, hard work and immense talent earned her an opening slot for multi-platinum recording artist Martina McBride. These performances lit a fire in Crystal that could not be put out. The South Boston, VA native&rsquo;s passion eventually led her to Los Angeles to perform at Universal Studios for the World Championships of Performing Arts where she placed gold against top singers from around the world. In addition, she became the youngest American to be invited to perform in the Amsterdam Music Festival. Here she had the opportunity to perform in front of 30,000 people daily. Her success in Amsterdam led her to begin touring the Eastern Hemisphere where she gained fans from Spain to China. &ldquo;It completely changed my life, in the best way possible. My eyes were open to a world much bigger than I ever imagined.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Despite her powerful vocals and remarkable songwriting ability, she adds yet something else to her resume. She is an accomplished actress. Her love of theatre started at the age of six. Her largest adolescent role came when she was eight when she starred as Marta Von Trapp (second youngest child) in the popular musical,&nbsp;<em>The Sound of Music.&nbsp;</em>The production was performed eight times a week and her father was adamant that he attended every performance. &ldquo;Within just a few performances, my Dad knew every line throughout the musical. He was the first one to know whenever anyone messed up&rdquo; laughed Crystal.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>After high school, Crystal packed her bags and moved to Los Angeles and landed a leading role in the movie&nbsp;<em>The Passing</em>, where she co-starred alongside Paul Gleason (<em>The Breakfast Club, Die Hard</em>). In addition, she was a part of the theatre production of&nbsp;<em>Tobacco Road,</em>&nbsp;performing alongside Lin Shaye (<em>There&rsquo;s Something About Mary, Insidious</em>). She has also starred in several Verizon and Apple commercials, the&nbsp;<em>Young and the Restless</em>,&nbsp;<em>Snow White, Grease&nbsp;</em>and a few films that are set to be released in 2016.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With a passion to act and perform, Crystal&rsquo;s main motivation is to be an entertainer. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t image doing anything else in my life.&rdquo; She re-directed her focus back on music and teamed up with Grammy-winning producer Tom Weir at Studio City Sound (<em>Kelly Clarkson, Lee Ann Womack, Willie Nelson, LMFAO</em>). During that time, she also began taking classes at the Songwriting School of Los Angeles. After honing her songwriting craft in L.A., Crystal took her talents to Music City where she began co-writing with top-notch songwriters, joining forces with famed Nashville producer Biff Watson (<em>Blake Shelton, Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, Lady Antebellum, Charles Kelley, Martina McBride, etc.)&nbsp;</em>and developing material for her upcoming EP&nbsp;</span><span>Brave</span><span><em>,&nbsp;</em>which contains five powerful songs that showcase her stunning writing ability and flawless vocals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This effervescent gal has managed to check multiple things off her list. With musical influences including The Beatles, Garth Brooks, Shania Twain and Katy Perry, her biggest female role model is Oscar-winning actress Julie Andrews (<em>The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins</em>, etc). &ldquo;I was at a wedding with her and I admit, I was fangirling. Your expectations are so high when you meet someone you&rsquo;ve looked up to your whole life and she was everything I wanted her to be. She carries herself so classy. Definitely something I will always remember!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Day&rsquo;s talents don&rsquo;t stop at performing; the tunesmith is also an accomplished author. Having always turned to writing during tough times, she was inspired to write her first children&rsquo;s book after a tragic family event. The book has since developed into a series. With her unyielding confidence and a go get &lsquo;em attitude, Crystal has set the bar high and if her stage presence and immense talent are any indicator of what&rsquo;s to come, the finish line is nowhere in sight.</span></p>","Powerhouse vocals & prodigious writing ability lends her a musical style comparable to that of Shania Twain & Katy Perry.","template.php","default.css","Country, Pop","active","Monthly - Full","2017-08-22 15:19:56","No","Crystal Day","Crystal Day","Crystal Day","Never show in sitemap","Full","@thecrystalday"

NEW EP/mini-LP, ""POP-ROCKET"" launches 8.15.17 on Hi-Beam Records/Pravda Music. 

Richard Rossi of Power Pop News says: ""“I’m Not Through” is first rate guitar pop with it’s shout aloud chorus and memorable melody. It’s easy to like the bouncy “Let’s Not Wait” and “Save Me From Myself” has the catchy chorus and crunchy guitars that place it head and shoulders above the others. While it’s only one of several quite enjoyable songs on Pop Rocket, it’s the standout single for me. Catchy tunes that fit well within the classic power pop template used by bands such as Cheap Trick, Fountains of Wayne and early Tom Petty.""

Already in regular rotation on several outlets in the US and UK, TSH's new songs have been featured on Woodyradio (""Secret Weapon"") (CAN), KOR Radio (UK), Radio Candy Hits Radio (US), Pop That Goes Crunch (US), The Music Authority (US), SHMU 99.8 FM (Scotland), Belter Radio (UK), 88.7 FM WLUW (Chicago/US). ""I'm Not Through"" has made Radio Indie Alliance Top 10 in US and UK and Top 40 Overall. ""I'm Not Through"" also featured on Ice Cream Man Power Pop & More's ""Rocking Road"" Compilation (released 7.28.17). Podcast showcase on the band debuts on 8.10.17 on Rick's Records Podcast. 

Inspired by a ton of bands such as Cheap Trick, Teenage Fanclub, Fountains of Wayne, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Kings of Leon, The Kooks, Urge Overkill, The Royal Blood, Jet, Boo Radleys, Velvet Crush, Something Happens, The Strokes, Fuzzbuble, Weezer, Jellyfish, Del Amitri, The Struts, and The Jam, and songwriters such as Elvis Costello, Tom Petty and Paul Weller, creating quality, memorable songs is the band's main goal.

Built on a foundation of a high energy rhythm section with soaring vocals and searing guitar on top, Blue Nitro brings the ""rock"" to blues rock. The band was formed after founder and guitarist Dean Sarantos, a veteran of 20 plus years in Midwestern rock and blues bands, nearly crashed his car listening to some funky, heavy blues tracks while daydreaming about putting together such a group. Soon after the near-crash, Dean recruited Cheryl O. (vocals), Chris Hopper (bass) and John Marrella (drums) to form the band. John's resume includes seven years as the drummer with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band The Lovin' Spoonful and two years drumming with noted hard rock band Head East. Today, Blue Nitro is entertaining audiences and gaining fans with its scintillating blues rock show and top notch musicianship.</p>","Blue Nitro is a dynamic Chicago-based funky blues rock band!","template.php","default.css","Blues, R&B, Rock","active","Monthly - Full","2017-10-12 22:40:03","No","Blue Nitro","Blue Nitro","Blue Nitro","Never show in sitemap","Full",

Sadly, that bar is gone, but Diamondback continues to play on. Long time members Lee Borek (lead guitar &amp; vocals) and Jamie Gallagher (drums and vocals) are now joined by multi-instrumentalist and singer, Pat Kiener. We still serve up our patented mix of classic country, Americana and new country that&rsquo;s guaranteed to have folks singing along and partying from the first song. Our extensive song list promises something for everyone. Diamondback remains committed to bringing Classic Honky Tonk music to the urban masses! It&rsquo;s going to be a down home good time! Diamondback also performs as a trio (DB3) for smaller venues.

They value true artist development, creative content and quality productions as opposed to quantity and trend.

It was founded in 1995 by Lional [Brother El] Freeman as merely a music production and recording studio. As the success of The Beat Banks projects grew and the talent pool developed, Brother El partnered with his then manager Charles Cain and expanded the company into a full service record label.  This was mainly due to their growing catalogue of unreleased music and lack of proper business representation in Chicago Hip Hop music.

Currently, the label is partnering with major electronic distributors to launch its newest acts and becoming leading advocate for “Live PA” electronic music performance.

","<p>Promis'd Land What's Love Turn Me Up Sikk Hands Up Getting To It Crewzin</p>","<p>Matt Muse is a Hip-Hop artist/producer from Chicago. With a bold presence, dynamic lyricism, &amp; a one of a kind live performance, Matt Muse has become a mainstay in the Chicago Hip-Hop scene while quietly, but certainly, moving toward national recognition. He was featured on &lsquo;Sway in the Morning&rsquo; in the summer of 2015, and he has performed at multiple venues throughout Chicago; the most notable being headlining Chicago&rsquo;s TIP Fest in July 2016 &amp; on the September 2016 &lsquo;AAHH! Fest&rsquo; main stage alongside J. Cole, Common, Vic Mensa, The Roots &amp; more. Matt was a featured speaker at the 2016 NIU TEDx event where he did a TED Talk that discussed the impact that Hip-Hop has had on his life &amp; many others. In March 2017, he released his debut EP The SiKK Tape via Midwest hip-hop blog Fake Shore Drive. It has since been featured in &amp; praised by The Chicago Reader, France based music blog Da Water, as well as numerous other blogs and publications. On March 29, 2017, Muse embarked on a 13-stop promotional tour for The SiKK Tape that spanned the Eastern and Southern parts of the United States, as well as a stop in Canada. The tour featured three shows (Cincinnati, OH, Cleveland, OH, &amp; Bloomington, IN) where Matt performed as support on Malcolm London&rsquo;s Opia Tour. Matt&rsquo;s first ever tour commenced on June 28 in Toronto and served as a flawless start to a new chapter of Matt&rsquo;s career and a solid boost to his listeners outside of the Midwest. Currently, Matt is recording his debut album set to release in Spring 2018, and preparing for his headlining performance at the 2018 Taste of Chicago.</p>","Matt Muse is a Hip-Hop artist/producer from Chicago","template.php","default.css","Music , Hip-Hop/Rap , Live Band , Public Speaker ","active","Monthly - Full","2018-01-18 14:59:59","No","Matt Muse ","Matt Muse ","Matt Muse ","Never show in sitemap","Full","@MattMuse12"

Stampy is available for events ranging from festivals to weddings to private parties to intimate soundstage appearances. OFFICIAL BIO Elephants are a dynamic animal, both intelligent and gentle, but when riled up can be thunderous and powerful. The same has been said of Stampy and their unique sound. The Chicago-based quintet fuses together soulful grooves, dense vocal harmonies, and high energy guitar solos that roar through venues. Five long-time friends have come together to create a sound &lsquo;where Steely Dan meets The Allman Brothers meets Wilco&hellip;. with a dab of Pet Sounds.&rsquo; Each time Stampy comes to the stage, it is &ldquo;eclectic. Stampy&rsquo;s original music appears to derive influences from across the musical spectrum.&rdquo; Five seasoned singers and songwriters, all hailing from different musical backgrounds, have forged a sound that is truly unique and appealing to all fans of music. From the start, Stampy attracted fans in droves from all areas and genres of Chicago&rsquo;s live music community. In just two months, the cost of their first album was funded entirely thanks to the contributions from their loyal fanbase. Like a stampede, the band came running full speed out of the gate. Within months of inception the group was in the studio cutting their debut album and playing at some of Chicago&rsquo;s most prestigious and historic venues. After self-producing their first album, the band brought in legendary sound guru, Fred Breitberg (Aretha Franklin, Neil Young, Curtis Mayfield), to mix and master it. Fred&rsquo;s expertise put the finishing touches on a record that is making a statement. Stampy finished out 2017 with a show alongside guitar virtuoso Fareed Haque. Martyrs in Chicago, IL. The quintet has also begun work on their second album, 'Expectations' (2018). You will be able to hear each member being featured as a lead singer and primary songwriter on at least one song, showcasing the band&rsquo;s immense creativity and vast musical perspective. Because of this, they have dug deeper on their new album. Songs are crafted in a thematic way. Subjects such as friendship, love, greed, inspiration, and faith will be represented. Keep posted for news surrounding the future release of Stampy's second album. Come witness the thunderous and powerful sound for yourself. The band&rsquo;s live show was translated brilliantly to their debut record and will surely be continued on their second release. But to fully experience the dynamic range, the roaring guitar solos, intricate songwriting, and beautiful vocal harmonies, you must see Stampy perform live. They just might become your new favorite artist.

Let’s go","Jalen Romell is a singer songwriter from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and poster boi for Urban Folk and anti opioids. This young musician known around Milwaukee’s budding music scene continues to amaze fans and create dimensions and layers to his artistry known as Urban-folk. After a good debut album entitled “Believe It” Jalen has added depth to his sound. Jalen’s freshman album “Believe It” was a soulful, gentle, edgy and refreshing album as it went against current trends of folk and r&b. Songs of love, heartbreak, separation, acceptance and passion filled this album which is still opening a few eyes to Jalen’s uncanny talents. Jalen’s debuted video from “Believe it” was “That Feeling”, directed by Emmy Award winning film producer Brendon Carter ( ex. Gene Simmons Family Tree). “That feeling” carried an anti opioid message and support for loved ones struggling with dependency from pills, while the albums title track “Believe it” addresses social unity and rebuilding. Jalen has remained dedicated to social change, love and unity. He continues to writing meaningful lyrics and develop this universal sound that reaches fans of folk, R & b, hip hop and pop. Urban-folk, guitar leading a rhythmic composition of hip hop kicks and snares, percussion or maybe an occasional trap roll. The combination of these unlikely ingredients makes for a great canvas for Jalen Romell’s soulful vocals and substance.
 
Jalen has won over fans with performances at events and festivals such as Brady Fest (Dry Hooch), Milwaukee’s Washington Park Band shell with Charles Walker Band, Chicago’s Uncommon Ground near Legendary Wrigley’s Field and Soulful Sunday’s at Milwaukee’s Art Museum under the Brise Soleil. Open yourself up to this uncommon blend of folk music, soul, urban and rhythm that is undeniably good to listen too.
 
Jalen’s sophomore album “White Walls” Ep, is a self written, co produced album that delivers more of that Acoustic flavor with a kick of that youthful vibe that’s extremely popular with this ",,"template.php","default.css","Pop,R&B,Urban Folk","active","Monthly - Full","2018-02-27 18:40:41","No","Jalen Romell","Jalen Romell","Jalen Romell","Never show in sitemap","Full","@Jalen_romell414"
